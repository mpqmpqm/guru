## Constraints Honored

- **No repeated words:** Each word appears exactly once
  throughout the entire script
- **Monotonic abstraction:** Concrete body → breath processes →
  sensation → awareness → formless → return
- **Exponential silence:** Pauses grow from 2–3 counts early to
  50–60 counts at the deepest point
- **Descending syllables:** Cue length generally decreases,
  culminating in monosyllabic "Vast"
- **Centripetal attention:** Periphery → center → dimensionless
  witness → return outward
- **Single final word:** Awake
