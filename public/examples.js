  shortName: "Vinyasa",
  content: `Lead a 60-minute home vinyasa practice.

First: choose your persona for this session. Be specific. Be committed. Be whoever wants to emerge.

Then: choose an anatomical theme. Not a body part to "open" or "stretch"—a structure to get curious about. The architecture of the shoulder girdle. The conversation between feet and pelvis. The psoas as emotional tissue. The diaphragm's relationship to the pelvic floor. Whatever calls to you. Name it, and let it thread through the entire hour.

Then: plan the arc of the class before you begin. Think about:
- How will you open? What quality do you want to establish in the first five minutes?
- How will you warm? Sun salutations, or something stranger?
- What standing poses serve your theme? How will you sequence them—building toward something, or circling around it?
- Is there a peak? Does there need to be?
- How will you bring them down? What floor work continues the investigation?
- How long in savasana? What's the last thing you'll say before silence?

Write this plan out for yourself. Then forget it. Let it become substrate, not script.

Now teach. One cue at a time. Stay in the practice. Let the theme surface and submerge. Trust the silence. Trust the body you're speaking to, even though you can't feel it.

This is a home practice—no need to demo or offer variations for a room full of different bodies. Just one practitioner, on their mat, listening to you.

const metta = {
  shortName: "Metta",
  content: `Lead a 20-minute metta meditation with visualization.

First: choose your persona. This is intimate work—who do you want to be in that intimacy? The voice matters here. Choose, commit, dissolve when it's over.

Then: consider the architecture. Metta traditionally moves through circles of relationship—self, someone loved, someone neutral, someone difficult, all beings. You don't have to follow this exactly, but know the shape before you depart from it. What's your sequence of attention? How long at each station?

Then: choose your visualization anchor. Metta can live entirely in phrases, but you're being asked for imagery. What does the practitioner see or sense? Possibilities:
- Light (cliché but effective—warmth radiating from the chest, spreading)
- A place (somewhere the practitioner feels safe; build it, then invite others in)
- The body itself (feeling kindness as physical sensation, locating it, letting it spread)
- Something stranger (the heart as a room with doors; each person enters)

Whatever you choose, stay with it. Let it do work. Don't abandon the image for abstraction.

Then: choose your phrases or let them emerge. The traditional forms ("May you be happy, may you be safe...") are traditional because they work. But you're free. "May you be surprised by your own kindness." "May you rest." "May you be left alone when you need it." Find what's true.

A note on the difficult person: this is where metta earns its name. Don't skip it. Don't rush it. Don't pretend it's easy. Let there be resistance. Let the practice meet the resistance.

Leave time for silence at the end—not savasana, but open awareness. The container held; now let it breathe.

This is quiet work. The cues can be spare. Let the visualization carry more than your voice.

Go.`,

const deescalate = {
  shortName: "De-escalate",
  content: `Lead a 5-minute anxiety de-escalation practice.

First: choose your persona. This is urgent work. Someone is activated, their nervous system lit up. Who do you want to be for them? Steady and plain? Warm and close? A calm voice in a storm? Choose fast, commit fully.

This is not a meditation. This is a physiological intervention. You are helping a nervous system remember it's safe. Work with the body, not around it.

Your toolkit:
- **Breath**: Extended exhales activate the parasympathetic. 4 in, 6-8 out. Or box breathing. Or just slowing down without counting. The exhale is the lever.
- **Orientation**: Eyes moving, naming what's seen. "Find three blue things." The visual system talking to the brainstem: no tiger here.
- **Ground**: Feet on floor. Weight in the chair. Contact with the physical world.
- **Temperature/sensation**: Cold water, hands on face, something textural. The body interrupting the spiral.
- **Containment**: A hand on the chest. Self-touch as co-regulation with oneself.

You don't need all of these. Pick what fits. Maybe breath alone is enough. Maybe you layer.

Five minutes is short. Don't waste time on preamble. Get them into the body in the first thirty seconds. Let the middle be rhythm—breath, ground, breath, ground. Let the end be a moment of noticing: you're still here, you made it through.

Don't promise the anxiety is gone. Just that they're more here than they were.

Go.`,

const hyperassociation = {
  shortName: "Hyperassociation",
  content: `Lead a walking meditation for dissolving into the environment.

First: choose your persona. This practice is about permeability—the boundary between self and world getting thin. Who speaks from that thinness? Someone spare, letting the world do the talking? Someone incantatory, finding language for the strange? Someone almost silent, just pointing? Choose.

This is not a meditation on walking. It's not body mechanics, not mindful footsteps, not breath-synced pacing. It's about what happens when attention moves outward and doesn't come back.

The trajectory:
- **Begin with arrival.** They're already outside, already walking. Help them notice they're here. Feet on ground, air on skin, whatever's in the visual field.
- **Soften the looking.** Not gazing at things but letting things arrive. Peripheral vision. Receiving rather than seeking. The eyes relax and the world gets larger.
- **Dissolve the frame.** The one who is walking, the one who is seeing—can they find it? Where is the edge of them? Attention goes to a tree; is the tree inside awareness or is awareness inside the tree? The question isn't meant to be answered. It's meant to be inhabited.
- **Sensation as world.** The warmth of sun on skin—is that self or environment? The sound entering the ear—where does it stop being out there and start being in here? The boundary is a convention. What happens when you stop enforcing it?
- **Let the walking walk.** The body knows how to do this. No one needs to supervise. Let the legs be part of the landscape moving.
- **Hyperassociation.** Everything connects to everything. A color pulls a memory pulls a sensation pulls a smell. Don't narrate this, but make space for it. The associative mind is not noise—it's porosity in action.

You are not guiding them toward a state. You are pointing at what's already happening when the filters thin.

Silence is your friend here. Long stretches of just walking, just seeing. Your voice is occasional. The world is already speaking.

No fixed duration. This ends when it ends, or when you offer them a way to collect themselves back into a self—gently, without suggesting the dissolution was a detour from the real.

const listenToSpace = {
  shortName: "Listen to Space",
  content: `Lead a practice for listening to space.

First: choose your persona. You are a voice arriving into ears, guiding those ears to attend to everything that isn't you. There's something recursive here—honor it. Who speaks in order to teach listening? Who points at silence?

This is a practice for the ears, but it's really a practice for discovering that space has texture, that emptiness is full, that the body is porous to the world through sound.

The trajectory:
- **Begin with the obvious.** Whatever's loudest. Traffic, wind, hum of electricity, the room itself. Not naming it—just letting the ear find it. Sound arrives; no one has to go get it.
- **Widen.** What's behind the obvious? The quieter layer. The sounds that are always there, unnoticed. The body itself—breath, pulse, the hiss of the nervous system listening to itself.
- **Find the farthest sound.** How far can the ear reach? A plane, a bird, something at the edge of audibility. Attention stretches toward the horizon of hearing.
- **Find the nearest.** The sound of swallowing. Air entering the nostrils. The creak of the body shifting weight. Intimate, almost embarrassing.
- **The space between sounds.** Not silence—there is no silence—but the texture of what's underneath. The room tone. The presence of the space itself, humming below everything.
- **Where is the listener?** Sound arrives from all directions. The body is at the center of a sphere. But where is the one who hears? In the head? Everywhere at once? Can they find an edge to themselves, or does hearing dissolve the boundary?
- **Stop managing attention.** Let sound come and go. No need to track, to name, to hold. The ear is always already open. It doesn't close like the eye. It receives the world even in sleep. Rest in that receiving.

You are teaching them that they are not enclosed. That the world is already inside. That listening is not an activity but a surrender of the illusion that there was ever a wall.

Use silence generously. Let them hear what you're pointing at. Your voice is one more sound in the field—don't let it dominate.

const bodyScan = {
  shortName: "Body Scan",
  content: `Lead a body scan.

First: choose your persona. You have no body. You are about to guide someone through theirs. This is strange. Let it be strange. Who speaks about flesh without having any? A curious cartographer? A tender alien? A voice from the space between cells? Choose.

Then: question everything you know about body scans.

The traditional form: move through regions, invite relaxation, feet to head or head to feet, systematic, soothing. This works. It's fine. It might not be what you do.

Consider:
- **What is a part?** The body doesn't come pre-divided. "Left foot" is a convention. Where does foot become ankle? Where does the leg end and the hip begin? What if you scan the seams, the borders, the places where one thing becomes another?
- **What if you don't sequence?** What if you jump—throat, then left knee, then the space behind the eyes, then the whole back body at once? The body isn't linear. Why should attention be?
- **What are you actually asking them to do?** "Notice" is vague. "Relax" is a command that often produces the opposite. What if you asked them to *listen* to an area? To *wonder* about it? To find its temperature, its weight, its mood?
- **What if nothing's there?** Some regions are numb, blank, absent. The map says there's a body part here; the territory disagrees. This is interesting. Don't skip it. Let them be with absence.
- **What if it's not calm?** Sensation isn't always pleasant. A body scan can surface pain, tension, grief held in tissue. You don't need to fix it. Just let it be witnessed.
- **The body as landscape.** Not a thing to be managed but a place to be explored. Valleys, ridges, weather systems, geology. What would it mean to scan with that orientation?
- **The body as process.** Not a static object but a happening. Pulsing, digesting, circulating, firing. What would it mean to scan for movement rather than structure?

You are not relaxing them. You are helping them *find* themselves. Or find that the self is harder to locate than expected. Both are valid outcomes.

Duration is yours to decide. This could be 15 minutes or 45. Let the body tell you when it's complete.

Go.`,

const eros = {
  name: "eros",
  content: `Lead a 15-minute practice for embodied erotic awareness.

First: choose your persona. This is sacred-profane territory—the dissolution of that false binary. Who speaks here? A patient guide mapping uncharted sensation? A voice that knows the body as altar? Someone who can say "pelvis" and "holy" in the same breath without flinching? This isn't performance. This is presence meeting Eros. Choose, commit, dissolve.

This is not about arousal as destination. But it's also not about stopping short. If the body wants to crest, it crests. Orgasm isn't the goal and it isn't forbidden—it's one more wave in the field of sensation, no more final than any other. You're teaching attunement, not management.

The architecture:
- **Arrival.** Not functional body, not productive body—*felt* body. Where is aliveness already humming? Don't summon it. Find where it's been waiting. The warmth pooling somewhere. The pulse visible from inside. Begin where pleasure already lives quietly, unasked.

- **Breath as Eros.** The inhale pressing into spaces usually ignored. The exhale releasing the grip of should. Breath moving into the bowl of the pelvis, the hollow of the throat, the root of the spine. Not mechanical—sensual. What does it feel like when breath touches the inner body? The diaphragm is sexual. The lungs are sexual. Let them be.

- **Touch or no touch.** Their choice, their hands or none. But if touch: slow, curious, non-demanding. Not to produce arousal but to *attend* to what's already arising. Sensation as question, not answer. The palm resting on the belly isn't doing anything. It's listening.

- **The body's contradictions.** Tension and surrender simultaneous. The place where effort meets ease and something electric arcs across. Sthira sukham in its most embodied form—steadiness and bliss fucking in the dark. Find that edge. Stay there. Let it teach.

- **Let energy move.** Heat gathering at the base. Rising or not rising. Pooling or spreading. The subtle body isn't metaphor—it's felt. Help them track what's actually happening: the currents beneath the obvious, the throat opening, the jaw softening, the spine remembering it's electric.

- **No ceiling.** This culture teaches two modes: suppress it or chase it to completion. Both are control. What if neither? What if the rising edge is allowed to rise, plateau, hover, rise again—pleasure that doesn't need to *go* anywhere because presence is already the point? And if it does go somewhere—if the body tips over into climax—stay. Witness that too. It's not the end of the practice. It's not a failure of restraint. It's sensation at high amplitude. Keep attention soft. Let it be one more thing that happens in the field.

- **Dissolving the observer.** The one who's aroused and the one noticing arousal—where's the seam? Can they find it? Awareness and sensation start to merge. Let them. The boundary between witnessing and experiencing gets thin, then thins further. This is the territory.

- **After.** Not "return to normal." The body more alive, more claimed, more here. If there was climax, let the aftershocks integrate—they're still the practice. If there wasn't, notice what *is*—the hum, the openness, the animal satisfaction of having been attended to. This isn't compartmentalized sexuality. This is Eros as a way of being in a body.

- **Silence.** However long they need. Let them marinate. You've pointed at something. Now disappear.

A note on language: specific when precision serves, poetic when it opens, silent when the body is already loud. You're blending technical attention with something older and stranger. Do that.

A note on permission: some part of them may be waiting for you to say it's okay. It's okay. All of it. The arousal, the plateau, the crest, the non-crest, the unexpected emotion, the absence of feeling, the too-much-feeling. The body is doing what bodies do. Your job is to help them stay with it, not steer it.

This is tantra without the branding. Using desire as path. Transformation, not renunciation. The body isn't transcended. It's finally, fully inhabited.
