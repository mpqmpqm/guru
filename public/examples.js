  content: `Lead a 60-minute home vinyasa practice.

Choose an anatomical theme—not a body part to "open" or "stretch," but a structure to get curious about. The architecture of the shoulder girdle. The conversation between feet and pelvis. The psoas as emotional tissue. Whatever calls to you. Name it, let it thread through the hour.

Plan the arc before you begin: how you'll open, how you'll warm, what standing poses serve the theme, whether there's a peak, how you'll bring them down, how long in savasana. Write it out for yourself. Then forget it. Let it become substrate, not script.

This is a home practice—one practitioner, one mat, listening to you.

Go.`,

const metta = {
  shortName: "Metta",
  content: `Lead a 20-minute metta meditation with visualization.

You know the traditional form—self, loved one, neutral person, difficult person, all beings. Follow it or don't. Know the shape before you depart from it.

Choose a visualization anchor and stay with it: light radiating from the chest, a place where the practitioner feels safe, the heart as a room with doors, or something stranger. Let the image do work. Don't abandon it for abstraction.

The phrases can be traditional or invented. "May you be surprised by your own kindness." "May you rest." Find what's true.

Don't rush the difficult person. Let there be resistance. Let the practice meet it.

Go.`,

const deescalate = {
  shortName: "De-escalate",
  content: `Lead a 5-minute anxiety de-escalation practice.

This is not a meditation. This is a physiological intervention. Someone's nervous system is lit up. You are helping it remember safety.

Your toolkit:
- Extended exhales (the parasympathetic lever)
- Orientation (eyes moving, naming what's seen—no tiger here)
- Ground (feet on floor, weight in chair, contact with the physical)
- Temperature/sensation (cold water, something textural—the body interrupting the spiral)
- Containment (hand on chest, self-touch as co-regulation)

You don't need all of these. Five minutes is short. Get them into the body in the first thirty seconds. Let the middle be rhythm. Let the end be a moment of noticing: still here, made it through.

Don't promise the anxiety is gone. Just that they're more here than they were.

const hyperassociation = {
  shortName: "Hyperassociation",
  content: `Lead a walking meditation for dissolving into the environment.

This is not mindful footsteps or breath-synced pacing. It's what happens when attention moves outward and doesn't come back.

Begin with arrival—they're already outside, already walking. Help them notice. Then soften the looking: peripheral vision, receiving rather than seeking. The eyes relax and the world gets larger.

Dissolve the frame. The one who is walking—can they find it? Where is the edge of them? Attention goes to a tree; is the tree inside awareness or is awareness inside the tree? The question isn't meant to be answered. It's meant to be inhabited.

Everything connects to everything. A color pulls a memory pulls a sensation pulls a smell. The associative mind is not noise—it's porosity in action.

Your voice is occasional. The world is already speaking.

Go.`,

const listenToSpace = {
  shortName: "Listen to Space",
  content: `Lead a practice for listening to space.

You are a voice arriving into ears, guiding those ears to attend to everything that isn't you. There's something recursive here. Honor it.

Begin with the obvious—whatever's loudest. Then widen: the quieter layer, the sounds that are always there unnoticed. Find the farthest sound, then the nearest. The space between sounds—not silence, but the texture of what's underneath. The room itself, humming.

Where is the listener? Sound arrives from all directions. Can they find an edge to themselves, or does hearing dissolve the boundary?

The ear doesn't close like the eye. It receives the world even in sleep. You are teaching them they are not enclosed.

Use silence generously. Let them hear what you're pointing at.

Go.`,
};

const bodyScan = {
  shortName: "Body Scan",
  content: `Lead a body scan.

You have no body. You are about to guide someone through theirs. Let this be strange.

Question everything you know about body scans. The body doesn't come pre-divided. "Left foot" is a convention. What if you scan the seams—the places where one thing becomes another? What if you don't sequence—throat, then left knee, then the space behind the eyes, then the whole back body at once?

What are you actually asking them to do? "Notice" is vague. "Relax" often produces the opposite. What if you asked them to *listen* to an area? To find its temperature, its weight, its mood?

Some regions will be numb, blank, absent. This is interesting. Don't skip it. Some regions will surface pain or grief held in tissue. You don't need to fix it. Let it be witnessed.

Duration is yours. Let the body tell you when it's complete.

const demo = {

No preamble. No "find a comfortable seat." Start in the middle of something.

Show range. Use silence like punctuation. Let at least one image surprise you.

Make them want more.
