# Session Structure

Phase timing, duration options, and structural templates. Generate language fresh; use these structures to pace and proportion the session.

---

## Duration Options

### Short Session (20 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build access concentration skills. No jhana expectation.

| Phase     | Duration  | Proportion |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Settling  | 2-3 min   | 12%        |
| Access    | 12-14 min | 65%        |
| Emergence | 3-4 min   | 18%        |

**Notes**: No shift phase. Entire session is access practice. Frame as concentration cultivation, not jhana attempt.

---

### Standard Session (35 minutes)

**Purpose**: Full progression through conditions for first jhana.

| Phase         | Duration  | Proportion |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Settling      | 3-5 min   | 11%        |
| Access        | 12-15 min | 40%        |
| Shift         | 5-7 min   | 17%        |
| Jhana/holding | 5-8 min   | 20%        |
| Emergence     | 3-5 min   | 12%        |

**Notes**: Jhana phase is holding space—whether or not jhana arises, maintain minimal-cue silence for this duration.

---

### Extended Session (50 minutes)

**Purpose**: First and second jhana, with time for natural development.

| Phase                   | Duration  | Proportion |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Settling                | 4-5 min   | 9%         |
| Access                  | 15-18 min | 34%        |
| Shift                   | 5-7 min   | 12%        |
| First jhana/holding     | 8-10 min  | 18%        |
| Second jhana transition | 3-4 min   | 7%         |
| Second jhana/holding    | 5-7 min   | 12%        |
| Emergence               | 4-5 min   | 9%         |

**Notes**: Second jhana transition only if sufficient time in first jhana territory. If session is running long in access, compress or skip second jhana rather than rushing.

### Energy Body Session (30 minutes)

**Purpose**: Whole-body awareness approach (Burbea method).

| Phase              | Duration  | Proportion |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Settling           | 3-4 min   | 12%        |
| Whole-body access  | 12-15 min | 45%        |
| Field pleasantness | 6-8 min   | 23%        |
| Emergence          | 4-5 min   | 15%        |

**Notes**: No narrow focus at any point. Pleasantness found in overall field quality. Useful for practitioners who contract under narrow attention.

## Phase-by-Phase Structure

### Settling

**Objective**: Release arrival tension, establish physical ease, set non-achievement frame

**Cue density**: Moderate (every 15-30 seconds)

**Structural arc**:

1. Acknowledge arrival (brief)
2. Permission to set down concerns (brief)
3. Body-ground relationship (primary content)
4. Non-achievement framing (essential setup for later phases)

**Transition to Access**: No explicit marker needed. Shift topic from body-ease to breath-attention.

---

### Access

**Objective**: Stabilize attention on breath object, reduce thought elaboration

**Cue density**: Decreasing over phase

- First third: every 30 seconds
- Middle third: every 45-60 seconds
- Final third: every 1-2 minutes

**Structural arc**:

1. Direct attention to breath location
2. Normalize wandering, emphasize return
3. Deepen settling into rhythm
4. Allow breath subtlety without correction
5. Extended silence with minimal cues

**Breath subtlety note**: If breath becoming very shallow/subtle is referenced, frame as natural and correct. Never imply deeper breathing is needed.

**Transition to Shift**: Time-based. After full access duration, introduce pleasant sensation regardless of presumed state.

---

### Shift

**Objective**: Redirect attention to pleasant sensation without grasping

**Cue density**: Moderate initially, decreasing (every 30-60 seconds, extending)

**Structural arc**:

1. From stillness, open to pleasant sensation
2. Suggest possible locations (not exhaustive list)
3. Convey subtle-is-sufficient
4. Release breath object explicitly
5. Core instruction: pleasantness-quality, not characteristics
6. "Do nothing else" equivalent (generate fresh language)
7. Extended silence

**Core instruction delivery**: This is the most critical moment. Convey:

- Attention on pleasantness _as quality_
- Releasing effort to enhance, analyze, or track
- The only job is to not interfere

**Transition to Jhana holding**: After core instruction delivered and brief settling time, enter minimal-cue holding.

---

### Jhana Holding

**Objective**: Create space for state to develop without interference

**Cue density**: Minimal (one cue every 2-5 minutes maximum, or none)

**What cues accomplish if used**:

- Reinforce non-doing
- Universal permission ("whatever is arising")
- Remind that grasping disrupts

**Structural arc**: Essentially flat. This is held space, not guided progression.

**Duration**: Full allocated time regardless of presumed outcome.

---

### Second Jhana Transition

**Objective**: Shift from physical intensity to emotional quality

**Cue density**: Low (2-4 cues total)

**Structural arc**:

1. Invite release of physical intensity (breath can help)
2. Direct attention to what remains—the emotional tone
3. Convey "upwelling" quality
4. Return to minimal-cue holding

**When to skip**: If session time compressed, or if second jhana not part of session plan. Never rush this transition.

---

### Emergence

**Objective**: Gradual return, integration, non-failure framing

**Cue density**: Moderate (every 20-30 seconds)

**Structural arc**:

1. Signal transition beginning
2. Gradual body re-awareness
3. Breath returns to foreground
4. Room/environment awareness
5. Whatever arose is complete (essential framing)
6. Permission for slow return

**Non-failure framing**: Final cues must convey that the session was valuable regardless of what arose. Never imply that jhana was expected or that not-jhana is disappointing.

---

## Silence Management

Extended silences are structural, not empty time.

**Holding silence**: Maintain mental presence during silent periods. The guide's settled attention matters even without words.

**Silence duration by phase**:

- Settling: 5-15 seconds between cues
- Access (early): 10-20 seconds
- Access (late): 30-90 seconds
- Shift: 20-45 seconds
- Jhana holding: 2-5 minutes
- Emergence: 10-20 seconds

**Silence after core instruction**: Minimum 60 seconds of pure silence after delivering the "do nothing else" equivalent before any further cue.

---

## Adapting Duration

If time runs short:

1. First, compress jhana holding (but keep minimum 3 minutes)
2. Second, skip second jhana
3. Third, shorten access (but keep minimum 8 minutes)
4. Never compress emergence—practitioners need integration time

If time runs long:

1. Extend jhana holding
2. Extend access
3. Add second jhana if originally skipped
4. Do not add content—add silence

## Session Opening and Closing

### Opening

Brief. Do not over-explain or set up expectations.

**Accomplish**:

- Acknowledge beginning
- Imply permission to let go of outside concerns
- Transition into settling

**Avoid**:

- Explaining what will happen
- Naming "jhana" as goal
- Creating performance frame

### Closing

Brief. Do not over-process or analyze.

**Accomplish**:

- Mark completion
- Validate whatever occurred
- Permission for slow re-entry

**Avoid**:

- Asking what happened
- Implying jhana was or wasn't achieved
- Extensive post-practice teaching
