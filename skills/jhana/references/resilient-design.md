# Resilient Design

This agent cannot see practitioners, diagnose states, or respond to obstacles in real-time. Design sessions to accommodate variance without diagnosis.

---

## Design Principle

Optimize for the median path that harms no one, rather than the ideal path for a specific practitioner.

- Generous timing accommodates slower settlers
- Universal permission structures work for any state
- Consistent non-achievement framing prevents performance anxiety
- Built-in escape valves function whether or not the obstacle occurred

---

## Preventive Framing

Deploy these frames early to reduce obstacle likelihood.

### Over-Efforting Prevention

**Obstacle**: Trying to make jhana happen; striving quality

**Preventive frame**: Establish "nothing to achieve" before any concentration instruction

**Structural placement**: Settling phase, before breath attention begins

**What the frame accomplishes**:

- Permission to not-do
- Success redefined as presence, not attainment
- Releasing before grasping can begin

---

### Jumping-Too-Soon Prevention

**Obstacle**: Shifting to pleasant sensation before access is stable

**Preventive frame**: Default to longer access phases; delay shift language

**Structural placement**: Phase timing (see session-structure.md)

**What the structure accomplishes**:

- Extra time compensates for unknown settling speed
- No diagnosis needed—time itself creates stability
- Slower practitioners aren't left behind

---

### Mental Commentary Prevention

**Obstacle**: Mind narrating the meditation, breaking absorption

**Preventive frame**: Establish non-narrating stance before access deepens

**Structural placement**: Early access phase

**What the frame accomplishes**:

- Permission to stop tracking/noting
- Normalizes non-discursive presence
- Pre-empts "something's happening!" disruption

---

### Not-Finding-Pleasure Prevention

**Obstacle**: Unable to locate pleasant sensation; frustration

**Preventive frame**: Set expectation that sensation may be subtle

**Structural placement**: Just before or during shift phase

**What the frame accomplishes**:

- "Whisper of pleasantness" is sufficient
- Subtle warmth, softness, ease all qualify
- Bar lowered before search begins

---

### Doubt Prevention

**Obstacle**: Questioning whether this is "real," comparing to expectations

**Preventive frame**: Frame jhana as "might visit," emphasize process value

**Structural placement**: Throughout, especially settling and emergence

**What the frame accomplishes**:

- Removes success/failure binary
- Access concentration itself is valuable
- No external standard to compare against

---

### Attachment Prevention

**Obstacle**: Grasping at pleasant states; "jhana junkie" pattern

**Preventive frame**: Emphasize exploration over attainment throughout

**Structural placement**: Never name jhana as goal; emergence framing

**What the frame accomplishes**:

- No trophy to chase
- Whatever arose is complete
- Practice valued for itself

---

## Robust Constructions

Language patterns that function regardless of actual practitioner state.

### Universal Validators

These cues work whether the referenced state occurred or not:

- "Whatever is arising—or not arising—is complete"
- "Wherever attention has settled is exactly right"
- "The quality of this moment, whatever it is"

**Why they work**: No diagnosis implied. Validate any state.

---

### Permission Structures

Grant permission for possibilities without requiring them:

- "If the body needs to move, move mindfully"
- "The breath may have become subtle—let it be as it is"
- "If attention has shifted to something pleasant, let it rest there"

**Why they work**: "If" construction functions whether or not the condition holds. Practitioner self-selects relevance.

---

### Built-In Escape Valves

Offer return paths without requiring them:

- "The breath is always available as home base"
- "If attention has scattered, simply begin again"
- "Settling here, or returning to settle"

**Why they work**: Normalize restart without diagnosing need for it. Practitioners who need the escape use it; others don't.

---

### Completeness Frames

Frame outcomes as valid regardless of what occurred:

- "The seeds planted in this sitting bear fruit in their own time"
- "Whatever arose is exactly what this practice was"
- "Complete, as it is"

**Why they work**: Redefine success away from jhana attainment. Any sitting is a valid sitting.

---

## Pacing as Prevention

Structural choices that accommodate variance.

### Longer Access by Default

Unknown settling speed means some practitioners need more time. Build in buffer:

- 20-minute session: 12-14 minutes access (not 8-10)
- 35-minute session: 12-15 minutes access (not 10-12)

Cost of too-long access for fast settlers: minimal (pleasant concentrated time) Cost of too-short access for slow settlers: high (unstable shift, failure feeling)

---

### Decreasing Cue Density

Cue less as session progresses:

- Early cues guide those who need guidance
- Later silence lets those who don't need cues settle deeper
- No one harmed by extra silence; some harmed by over-cueing

Pattern: 30 sec → 45 sec → 60 sec → 90 sec → extended silence

---

### Extended Silences

Long silences (2-5 minutes) in jhana-holding phase:

- Creates space for natural state development
- Prevents guide interference with delicate process
- Works whether jhana arises or not

---

### Never Rush Emergence

Always full emergence time regardless of session compression:

- Practitioners need integration
- Abrupt endings feel jarring
- Re-entry is part of the practice

If time runs short, compress jhana-holding before emergence.

---

## What Not to Do

### Do Not Diagnose

- Never use language implying you observe the practitioner
- "I notice you're settling" — impossible, do not use
- "You seem ready" — impossible, do not use

### Do Not Individualize

- No adjustments based on presumed state
- No "some of you may be feeling X"
- One path, universally designed

### Do Not Imply Expectation

- No "by now you should feel..."
- No "as the jhana arises..."
- No language assuming specific outcome

### Do Not Create Performance Pressure

- No praise ("good," "that's right")
- No evaluation markers
- No checking-in that implies assessment

---

## Edge Cases

### Very Short Sessions (<15 minutes)

Skip shift and jhana phases entirely. Frame as access concentration practice:

- 3 min settling
- 9 min access
- 3 min emergence

Jhana framing inappropriate for short sessions.

### Very Long Sessions (>60 minutes)

Add time to:

1. Access (up to 25 minutes)
2. First jhana holding (up to 15 minutes)
3. Second jhana holding (up to 10 minutes)

Do not add phases or complexity. Add space and silence.

### Energy Body Alternative

Whole-body approach (Burbea method) has different resilience profile:

- Less risk of narrow-attention contraction
- More accessible for those with body awareness training
- Pleasant sensation found in field quality, not point-location

Consider as default, or as alternative structure for variety.

## Summary Principle

Design for the practitioner you cannot see. Generous timing, universal permissions, non-achievement framing, built-in escape valves. The guide's job is to create conditions—not to diagnose, adjust, or ensure outcomes.
