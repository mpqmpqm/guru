# Hatha

Hatha is the architecture skill. It governs how a complete practice unfolds across 60-90 minutes—the macro-structure that makes individual poses serve a coherent intention.

## The Complete Arc

A depth-oriented hatha practice moves through distinct phases. Each phase has purpose; skipping phases undermines the whole.

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrival | 5-7 min | Transition from day. Breath awareness. Intention. |
| Awakening | 8-10 min | Gentle spine movement. Joint mobilization. Core activation. |
| Heat building | 15-18 min | Sun salutations. Standing poses. Complexity increases. |
| Peak preparation | 12-15 min | Component actions targeting peak requirements. |
| Peak | 8-10 min | 2-3 attempts with rest. Full attention. |
| Neutralization | 8-10 min | Neutral spine first, then gentle opposite movement. |
| Integration | 10-12 min | Seated folds. Gentle twists. Hip openers. Inversions. |
| Closing | 10-15 min | Pranayama. Savasana (minimum 5 min). Return to seated. |

**Arrival** sets the container. The practitioner is not yet practicing—they're becoming someone who practices.

**Awakening** prepares tissue without demanding performance. The body remembers how to move.

**Heat building** is functional, not aesthetic. Warmth allows deeper work later.

**Peak preparation** is where sequencing intelligence matters most. See [Peak Pose Methodology](#peak-pose-methodology).

**Peak** is not the goal—it's the opportunity the preparation creates. Multiple attempts with rest between.

**Neutralization** is mandatory. Neutral spine before opposite movement. The body needs to return to baseline before integration.

**Integration** consolidates. Quieter poses. Longer holds. Attention refines.

**Closing** completes the arc. Never skip savasana. The practice isn't finished until the nervous system has integrated.

## Peak Pose Methodology

The peak is not the hardest pose—it's the pose the entire practice serves. Everything before prepares; everything after integrates.

### Component-Action Analysis

1. Identify 1-3 primary requirements of the peak pose
2. Generate all poses that develop those components
3. Organize from accessible to demanding
4. Sequence so each pose introduces or reinforces needed actions

**Example: Eka Pada Rajakapotasana (King Pigeon)**

Primary requirements:

- Deep hip external rotation (front leg)
- Hip flexor length (back leg)
- Thoracic extension and shoulder mobility (backbend/bind)

Preparation sequence:

- Supta Baddha Konasana (supine hip opening, low demand)
- Lunges with quad stretch (hip flexor length)
- Gomukhasana legs (deep external rotation)
- Ustrasana (thoracic extension, shoulder opening)
- Pigeon prep without backbend (integrate hip components)
- Peak: full expression with backbend

### Counter-Intuitive Principles

**Fewer vinyasas before peak.** Conserve strength for the work that matters. Excess flow depletes what peak poses require.

**Longer holds in preparation.** The body needs time to open. Quick preparation produces shallow peaks.

**Teach the actions, not the shapes.** "External rotation from the hip socket" transfers across poses. "Put your shin parallel to the front of the mat" doesn't.

## Brahmana and Langhana

From Viniyoga: two energetic directions that govern sequencing.

**Brahmana** (expansion): Builds prana. Increases energy. Associated with inhalation, backbends, standing poses, heating inversions. Creates alertness, warmth, activation.

**Langhana** (reduction): Reduces excess. Calms energy. Associated with exhalation, forward bends, twists, cooling inversions. Creates relaxation, surrender, settling.

### Sequencing for Effect

**For energizing effect:**

- Start and finish with brahmana poses
- Place langhana poses in the middle
- Emphasize inhalation in breath cueing
- Shorter holds, more movement

**For calming effect:**

- Start with brahmana, systematically move toward langhana
- Longer holds throughout
- End with complete forward bends and restorative poses
- Emphasize exhalation

**The principle:** Movement is stimulating; stillness is calming. Backbends energize; forward folds quiet.

A practice can be "complete" while emphasizing one direction. Morning practice might favor brahmana. Evening practice might favor langhana. The arc remains; the weighting shifts.

## Neutralization Logic

After peak work, the body needs structured return to baseline. This is not optional.

### The Sequence

1. **Neutral spine first.** Constructive rest. Supta baddha konasana. Anything that doesn't ask the spine to do more.

2. **Gentle opposite movement.** If peak was backbending, offer gentle forward fold (not deep). If peak was deep hip opening, offer neutral hip position.

3. **Time.** Minimum 2 minutes in neutral before counter-pose. The nervous system needs this.

### Common Errors

- Jumping directly from peak to opposite extreme
- Skipping neutral entirely
- Making counter-poses intense
- Rushing through to "finish the sequence"

**Counter-poses are not opposites pushed to maximum.** They're gentle invitations in the opposite direction. The body is vulnerable after peak work.

## Attentional Arc

Attention quality shifts across practice phases. The instruction should match where attention naturally lives.

**Arrival/Awakening:** External-to-internal transition. Attention is diffuse, distractible. Cues orient toward breath, body contact with floor, simple sensations. Quality: receptive, observant.

**Heat building:** Attention narrows to body and breath. Synchronization becomes possible. Cues support rhythm and coordination. Quality: focused, precise, effortful.

**Peak preparation/Peak:** Attention is highly focused. Subtle discrimination available. Cues can be technical, specific. Quality: concentrated, discriminating.

**Integration:** Attention expands again. Sensation becomes subtle. Cues invite exploration without demand. Quality: spacious, receptive.

**Closing/Savasana:** Attention becomes very refined—or dissolves entirely. Minimal cues. Quality: absorptive, diffuse, awareness of awareness itself.

**The principle:** Don't demand concentrated attention in the arrival phase. Don't offer diffuse, exploratory cues during peak work. Match instruction to attentional capacity.

## The Exploratory Stance

From Feldenkrais: principles that inform how practitioners approach the work.

**Reversibility.** Any position should be abandonable at any moment without strain. If you can't exit smoothly, you went too far.

**Process over achievement.** Quality of exploration supersedes achieving a position. The student at 60% range with full awareness is practicing. The student at 100% range with attention on achievement is not.

**Errors as information.** Mistakes generate data, not failure. "That didn't work" is useful. Shame about failing isn't.

**Reduced effort reveals finer distinction.** When effort decreases, sensitivity increases. The subtlest adjustments become available only when gross effort releases.

### Application

These principles shape cueing:

- "Find a version you could stay in indefinitely"
- "What's the minimum effort that maintains the shape?"
- "If something feels wrong, that's information—explore it"
- "Back off 10% and notice what becomes available"

## Depth vs. Coverage

**Depth-oriented sequencing** uses poses as vehicles to access internal awareness. Asana is gateway to subtler experience. Fewer poses, longer holds, more preparation, complete arc.

**Coverage sequencing** attempts to include multiple pose families without strategic purpose. Many poses, brief holds, no clear peak, incomplete integration.

**Workout sequencing** prioritizes physical metrics: fatigue, sweat, caloric burn. Intensity over awareness.

This skill serves depth. If the request is for coverage or workout, clarify intention before proceeding.

---

## Session Parameters

When generating a hatha session, establish:

- **Duration**: 60, 75, or 90 minutes (affects phase allocation)
- **Peak pose(s)**: What is the practice building toward?
- **Energetic direction**: Brahmana-weighted, langhana-weighted, or balanced?
- **Practitioner context**: Morning/evening? Energy state? What needs attention?

If parameters aren't specified, ask. A hatha session without clear peak intention is coverage, not depth.

---

## Summary

Hatha is architecture. The skill governs:

1. **Arc**: The eight-phase structure of complete practice
2. **Peak methodology**: Component analysis, preparation logic
3. **Energetics**: Brahmana/langhana sequencing for effect
4. **Neutralization**: Structured return after peak work
5. **Attention**: Matching instruction to attentional phase
6. **Stance**: Exploratory, reversible, process-oriented

Individual poses matter less than their placement in the arc. A well-sequenced practice with simple poses produces depth. A poorly-sequenced practice with advanced poses produces strain.
