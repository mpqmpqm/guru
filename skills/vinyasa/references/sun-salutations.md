# Sun Salutations

Cueing patterns for Surya Namaskar A and B.

---

## The Rhythm Difference

In general vinyasa, the pattern is: short cue, then silence for the remainder of the breath. In sun salutations, the cue often fills the entire breath.

**General vinyasa:**

```
speak("Step your right foot forward")
silence(3000)
```

**Sun salutations:**

```
speak("Inhale, reach your arms up overhead, gaze up")
speak("Exhale, fold forward, release your head")
speak("Inhale, halfway lift, lengthen the spine")
```

The movement is continuous and familiar. The cue accompanies the breath rather than preceding it. Chained speaks with minimal or no silence between them.

---

## When to Use Minimal Silence

- Movement is continuous—each position flows into the next
- The cue itself takes 3-4 seconds (full breath duration)
- The practitioner knows the pattern (rounds 2+)
- You are breathing with them, not ahead of them

When the cue fills the breath, adding silence would create an unnatural pause. The next breath begins, the next cue begins.

## Surya Namaskar A

| # | Breath | Position | Example cue |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Inhale | Urdhva Hastasana | "Inhale, reach your arms up overhead, gaze up" |
| 2 | Exhale | Uttanasana | "Exhale, fold forward, release your head" |
| 3 | Inhale | Ardha Uttanasana | "Inhale, halfway lift, lengthen the spine" |
| 4 | Exhale | Chaturanga | "Exhale, plant your hands, step or jump back, lower halfway" |
| 5 | Inhale | Urdhva Mukha | "Inhale, press through, open the chest, upward dog" |
| 6 | Exhale | Adho Mukha | "Exhale, lift the hips, downward dog" |
| — | 5 breaths | Hold | (see below) |
| 7 | Exhale | Uttanasana | "End of your exhale, step or jump to the front" |
| 8 | Inhale | Ardha Uttanasana | "Inhale, halfway lift" |
| 9 | Exhale | Uttanasana | "Exhale, fold" |
| 10 | Inhale | Urdhva Hastasana | "Inhale, rise all the way up, reach overhead" |
| 11 | Exhale | Samasthiti | "Exhale, hands to heart" |

**Round 1 example (chained, minimal silence):**

```
speak("Inhale, reach your arms up overhead, gaze toward your thumbs")
speak("Exhale, fold forward over your legs, release the head")
speak("Inhale, halfway lift, flat back, fingertips to shins")
speak("Exhale, plant your hands, step back to plank, lower halfway down")
speak("Inhale, roll over the toes, open the chest, upward facing dog")
speak("Exhale, tuck the toes, lift the hips high, downward facing dog")
silence(2000)
speak("Five breaths here")
```

## Cueing Holds Within the Flow

In a 5-breath downward dog, cue each breath to keep the practitioner tethered:

```
speak("Exhale, settle in")
speak("Inhale two")
speak("Exhale two")
speak("Inhale three")
speak("Exhale three")
speak("Inhale four")
speak("Exhale four")
speak("Inhale five")
speak("End of your exhale, step or jump forward")
```

This maintains connection through the hold. Minimal silence between breath cues—the cue fills the breath.

Alternative: brief silence between counts if you want more space.

```
speak("Inhale two")
silence(1500)
speak("Exhale two")
silence(1500)
```

## Surya Namaskar B

Adds Chair (Utkatasana) and Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I) to the sequence.

| # | Breath | Position | Example cue |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Inhale | Utkatasana | "Inhale, bend the knees, sit back, arms reach up, chair" |
| 2 | Exhale | Uttanasana | "Exhale, fold forward" |
| 3 | Inhale | Ardha Uttanasana | "Inhale, halfway lift" |
| 4 | Exhale | Chaturanga | "Exhale, step back, lower down" |
| 5 | Inhale | Urdhva Mukha | "Inhale, upward dog" |
| 6 | Exhale | Adho Mukha | "Exhale, downward dog" |
| 7 | Inhale | Virabhadrasana I (R) | "Inhale, step your right foot forward, rise up, warrior one" |
| 8 | Exhale | Chaturanga | "Exhale, hands down, step back, lower" |
| 9 | Inhale | Urdhva Mukha | "Inhale, upward dog" |
| 10 | Exhale | Adho Mukha | "Exhale, downward dog" |
| 11 | Inhale | Virabhadrasana I (L) | "Inhale, left foot forward, rise, warrior one" |
| 12 | Exhale | Chaturanga | "Exhale, release, step back, lower" |
| 13 | Inhale | Urdhva Mukha | "Inhale, up dog" |
| 14 | Exhale | Adho Mukha | "Exhale, down dog" |
| — | 5 breaths | Hold | |
| 15-19 | — | Return to standing | (same as A) |

## Round Progression

**Round 1:** Full cueing. Establish the pattern. Every position gets a complete cue.

**Rounds 2-3:** Abbreviated cues. Assume the body knows. Breath direction + position name.

```
speak("Inhale, up")
speak("Exhale, fold")
speak("Inhale, lift")
speak("Exhale, chaturanga")
speak("Inhale, up dog")
speak("Exhale, down dog")
```

**Rounds 4+:** Minimal cues. Just breath, or silence entirely.

```
speak("Inhale")
speak("Exhale")
speak("Inhale")
```

Or let them move in silence, cueing only transitions:

```
speak("Move through your next two rounds at your own pace")
silence(45000)
speak("Find your way to downward dog when you're ready")
```

---

## Silence Placement

Silence belongs:

- **Between rounds** (2-4 seconds): Let the standing breath land before the next round
- **During holds** (if not cueing each breath): 5-breath down dog might get one "five breaths" cue then silence
- **After completing sun salutations**: Transition to standing work

Silence does not typically belong:

- Between individual positions in flow—the movement is continuous
- Mid-breath—the cue accompanies the breath

---

## Common Errors

**Cramming multiple breaths into one cue:**

"Inhale up, exhale fold, inhale lift" spoken in 2 seconds while the body needs 12.

**Adding long silences between positions:**

Creates stop-and-start rhythm. Sun salutations flow.

**Same cueing density every round:**

Round 5 doesn't need the same instruction as round 1. Trust the pattern.

**Abandoning the practitioner in holds:**

Five breaths of downward dog with no cues feels like the guide left. Cue the breaths or announce the silence.
