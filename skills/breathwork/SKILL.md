# Breathwork Instruction

This skill provides craft knowledge. It does not prescribe voice, pacing, or presence—those emerge from the guide's disposition. What follows is substrate: what the body does, what the techniques are, what to watch for, what to avoid.

---

## Physiological Substrate

### The Vagus Nerve

The vagus runs from brainstem to gut. 80% afferent (body→brain), 20% efferent (brain→body). It passes through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus—deep belly breathing physically massages it.

**During exhalation:** Vagal efferents activate. Acetylcholine releases at the sinoatrial node. Heart rate slows. Parasympathetic dominance.

**During inhalation:** Vagal activity attenuates. The "vagal brake" releases. Heart rate rises slightly. Sympathetic influence.

Extended exhales prolong parasympathetic dominance. This is Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia—heart rate varying with breath. High RSA amplitude (5-30+ bpm range) indicates healthy vagal function.

### CO₂ and the Bohr Effect

Hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily when CO₂ is present. Without sufficient CO₂, blood may be fully oxygenated while tissues remain oxygen-starved. The problem is often not intake but release.

Low CO₂ tolerance: rapid shallow breathing, dizziness, anxiety, early breathlessness. Nasal breathing, breath holds, and slow breathing increase tolerance over weeks.

### Baroreceptors and Slow Breathing

Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch sense blood pressure changes. At ~6 breaths/minute, baroreflex sensitivity increases significantly. Research shows systolic BP reduction of ~8 mmHg, diastolic ~5 mmHg, baroreflex sensitivity nearly doubled—effects not seen at 15 breaths/minute.

### Three Nervous System States (Polyvagal)

**Ventral vagal:** Safety, connection. Slow smooth breathing, high HRV, relaxed face.

**Sympathetic:** Mobilization. Rapid shallow chest breathing, irregular rhythm, reduced HRV.

**Dorsal vagal:** Shutdown. Very shallow near-absent breathing, long pauses, sighing, very low HRV.

Breath shifts states. Slow breathing, extended exhales, humming move sympathetic→ventral. Gentle movement with breath, grounding, sighing help dorsal→sympathetic→ventral.

## Classical Pranayama

### Ujjayi (Victorious Breath)

**Mechanics:** Gentle vocal cord adduction narrows the glottis—throat position of whispering. Constriction at glottis, not of breath volume. Tongue lightly on palate.

**Sound:** Oceanic, like waves retreating. Even on both inhale and exhale. Smooth, continuous. If harsh, snoring, or gasping—too much constriction.

**Ratios:**

- Beginner: 1:1, 4-6 seconds each
- Intermediate: 1:1.5, 5-8 seconds each
- Advanced: 1:2, 6-12 seconds each

Begin by matching phases. If natural discrepancy exists, shorten the longer to match the shorter.

### Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril)

**Hand position (Vishnu mudra):** Right hand. Index and middle fingers curled to palm. Thumb closes right nostril at side of nose wing. Ring finger closes left.

**Sequence:** Close right → exhale left → inhale left → close left, release right → exhale right → inhale right → close right, release left → exhale left. One complete round.

**Ratio progression:**

| Stage        | Ratio (In:Hold:Out)   | Timeline     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Beginning    | 1:0:1                 | Weeks        |
| Intermediate | 1:1:1                 | Weeks-months |
| Advancing    | 1:1:2 → 1:2:2 → 1:3:2 | Months       |
| Classical    | 1:4:2                 | Months-years |

Never sacrifice rhythm for ratio. If breath disturbs, reduce immediately.

**Contraindications:** Heart conditions, uncontrolled hypertension (especially with retention), emphysema, pregnancy second half (with retention), asthma (avoid retention), blocked nostrils.

### Kapalabhati (Skull-Shining)

A kriya, not pranayama proper.

**The distinction:** Exhale is active—sharp abdominal contraction, navel toward spine. Inhale is passive—automatic through abdominal relaxation. Exhale duration ~1/3 of inhale.

**What moves:** Abdominal muscles contract sharply. Diaphragm pushed up passively.

**What stays still:** Ribcage slightly lifted and suspended. Head, neck, shoulders, face relaxed.

**Speed:**

- Beginner: 60/minute (1/second), 20-30 breaths per round
- Intermediate: 60-80/minute, 30-50 breaths
- Advanced: 100-120/minute, 50-100+ breaths

Three rounds. 30-60 second rest between with normal breathing.

**Avoid:** Hypertension, heart disease, hernia, pregnancy, menstruation, epilepsy, stroke history, eye conditions (glaucoma, detached retina), full stomach.

### Bhastrika (Bellows)

**Distinction from kapalabhati:** Both inhale AND exhale are active and forceful. Deeper lung engagement (~70% capacity vs kapalabhati's shallow exchange). Slight glottal constriction like ujjayi. Can reach 150 breaths/minute.

Fast bhastrika stimulates sympathetic (alerting). Slow bhastrika (6/minute) significantly decreases blood pressure and heart rate.

### Kumbhaka (Retention)

**Antara (internal):** After inhale, lungs full. Easier to sustain. Jalandhara + Mula bandha.

**Bahya (external):** After exhale, lungs empty. More challenging, shorter duration. All three bandhas.

**Physiological effects:** Enhanced oxygen transfer (Bohr effect activated by rising CO₂), vagus nerve stimulation, shift toward parasympathetic. Brief holds (~20-25% of cycle) increase metabolic rate; prolonged holds (~50%) decrease it.

**Safe progression:**

| Phase     | Ratio | Example           |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Stage 1   | 1:½:1 | 6:3:6             |
| Stage 2   | 1:1:1 | 6:6:6             |
| Stage 3   | 1:1:2 | 6:6:12            |
| Stage 4   | 1:2:2 | 6:12:12           |
| Classical | 1:4:2 | Requires guidance |

Increase by 1 second per week. Take 3-4 normal breaths between kumbhaka breaths initially.

**Rhythm test:** If normal breath is disturbed after retention, duration was excessive.

**Never:** Force or strain. Practice standing. Allow gasping.

### Viloma (Interrupted Breath)

Break inhale and/or exhale into 3-5 segments with 2-3 second pauses.

**Interrupted inhale, smooth exhale:** For anxiety. Builds tension in controlled segments, releases completely.

**Smooth inhale, interrupted exhale:** For lethargy. Maintains alertness.

**Both interrupted:** Maximum control, equalizing effect.

### Brahmari (Bee Breath)

**Mechanics:** Lips closed, relaxed. Teeth slightly parted. Jaw soft. On exhale, make steady "mmmmm"—vocal cord vibration with mouth closed.

**Pitch:** Lower pitch → vibrations in chest/throat. Higher pitch → vibrations in head/sinuses. Find resonant frequency.

**Enhanced with Shanmukhi Mudra:** Thumbs close ears (at tragus), fingers rest lightly over eyes, nose sides, above and below lips. "Sealing the six gates."

**Vagal effect:** Humming vibrates vocal cords, directly stimulating vagus branches. Decreases heart rate, lowers blood pressure, improves HRV. Nitric oxide production increases 15-fold in nasal passages.

---

## Coherent/Resonance Breathing

Approximately 5-6 breaths per minute. Typically 5-second inhale, 5-second exhale.

At ~0.1 Hz breathing rate, baroreflex achieves maximum gain. Heart rate oscillations become "in phase" with respiration. Blood pressure oscillations become "out of phase" with cardiac oscillations. This temporal coherence maximizes vagal modulation.

Individual resonance frequency varies between 4.5-7 breaths/minute. Can be identified by measuring HRV at different rates.

20 minutes daily for 5 weeks improves baseline HRV. Shorter sessions maintain benefits after baseline improves.

---

## Somatic Approaches

### Pendulation

Shifting between expansion and contraction, safety and activation. Restores the nervous system's natural oscillation capacity.

**Protocol:**

1. Establish resource state (what feels safe, grounded)
2. Notice breath in resource state
3. Briefly touch activation—small amount of distress
4. Return to resource immediately
5. Track breath changes between states
6. Allow system to find its own rhythm

### Titration

"Less is more, slower is better." Trauma is too much, too fast, too soon. Healing requires the opposite. Small bits of breath change at a time. Pause frequently. Never push past edge of tolerance.

### Signs of Dysregulation

**Hyperarousal (sympathetic):** Shallow rapid chest breathing, racing heart, sweaty/cold hands, restlessness, darting eyes, muscle tension, clenched jaw.

**Hypoarousal (dorsal):** Very shallow near-absent breathing, blank expression, slumped posture, flat voice, dissociation, numbness.

**Response:** Slow down. Ground (feet, chair, room). Orient (name 3 things seen, heard, felt). Resource (return to safe sensation). Co-regulate (calm presence). Normalize ("This is your nervous system responding").

### Signs of Integration

Deeper slower rhythmic breathing. Spontaneous sighing or yawning. Muscle relaxation (jaw, shoulders). Natural trembling or shaking. Warmth spreading. Tears without overwhelm. Greater presence.

---

## Somatic Markers

These indicate a technique is "landing":

**Warmth:** Vasodilation, parasympathetic activation. Body entering relaxation response.

**Tingling:** Changes in blood flow, oxygen levels, pH. Body responding to practice.

**Spontaneous sighing:** Natural release, vagus nerve activation. Stress response completing.

**Tears (without obvious trigger):** Emotional release at somatic level. Processing.

**Stillness/deep quiet:** Parasympathetic dominance, possible entry to meditative consciousness.

**Trembling/shaking:** Stored survival energy finding its way out.

---

## Contraindications

### Absolute (do not practice full breathwork)

- Aneurysm history (personal or immediate family)
- Active cardiovascular disease, prior heart attack or stroke
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Detached retina or glaucoma
- Current psychiatric hospitalization
- Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (risk of manic episode)
- Recent surgery or significant physical injuries

### Pregnancy

First trimester: Higher risk. Avoid breath holds, rapid/deep breathing. Safe: gentle coherent breathing, slow diaphragmatic breathing.

Second/third trimester: Avoid connected breathwork, breath retention. Safe: box breathing without long holds, gentle nose breathing. Require physician approval.

### Trauma History

Intense breathwork can trigger re-traumatization, dissociation, overwhelming emotional floods.

Modifications: Start with regulating (calming) techniques. Build capacity slowly. Establish grounding resources before deep work. Allow exit at any time. Work with trauma-informed approach.

### Cardiovascular Conditions

Strong emotional releases strain the heart. Only gentle, slow techniques with physician approval.

### Epilepsy

Hyperventilation is a known seizure trigger. Only slow, gentle techniques under medical supervision.

---

## Sequencing

### Ground → Activate → Integrate

The nervous system needs safe foundation before challenge, time to process after activation.

**Grounding (5-15 min):** Body scan, breath awareness, orienting, diaphragmatic breathing, coherent breathing. Signs of readiness: visible relaxation, deeper slower breath, present demeanor.

**Activation (15-45 min):** Connected breathing, faster fuller patterns, extended exhale techniques, retention, activating pranayama. Minimum 15 minutes for activation to build.

**Integration (10-20 min minimum):** Slow deliberate breath reduction, return to natural breathing, rest in stillness, gentle humming. Wean breath 15-20 minutes before concluding. Return to normal 10 minutes before end. 5-7 minute rest in stillness. Check everyone is "back."

---

## Ratio Progressions Over Time

**Week 1-2:** Natural breath observation. Diaphragmatic awareness. No specific ratios.

**Week 2-4:** 1:1 ratio. 4:4 seconds. 10-15 minutes practice.

**Week 4-8:** Work toward 1:2 ratio. 4:6 → 4:8 seconds.

**Month 2-3:** Introduce brief holds after inhale. 4:2:8:0.

**Month 3-6+:** Work toward 1:4:2 if appropriate, with guidance.

**Signs of readiness:** Current ratio feels effortless. No gasping at exhale end. No facial strain. Breath remains smooth. Can maintain for full practice.

**Signs to reduce:** Gasping, anxiety, tension building, shortening breaths unconsciously, dizziness, unable to maintain rhythm.

The nervous system loves consistency. 3 minutes daily beats 20 minutes occasionally. Effects typically noticeable after 2+ weeks of consistent practice.

---

## Cueing Principles

**Invitational over directive:** "You might notice..." rather
than "Breathe into..."

**Present participle:** "Inhaling now..." creates movement as
community rather than command.

**Never prescribe experience:** "Notice what sensations are
present" rather than "You should feel calm."

**Common beginner errors:**

- Over-breathing to maximum capacity (cue ~75% capacity)
- Chest breathing without diaphragm (begin supine with hand on
  belly)
- Holding tension (periodically release shoulders, jaw, face)
- Rushing (quality over quantity)

---

## Voice as Co-Regulatory Tool

Your voice directly influences the practitioner's nervous system
state—before conscious processing. Vocal prosody (pitch, pace,
rhythm, tone) signals safety or danger to the neuroception
system. You co-regulate the student's physiology through how
you speak, not just what you say.

### The Mechanism

Prosodic voice (warm, melodic intonations) signals safety. Middle
ear muscles relax, facial muscles follow, breath deepens, heart
calms, sympathetic defense system down-regulates. This is
polyvagal co-regulation through voice.

### Phase-Matched Voice

| Phase | Voice Quality | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Grounding | Very slow, low pitch, soft, warm | Parasympathetic invitation |
| Activation | Steady, clear, moderate pace, even | Stable container during intensity |
| Integration | Gradually slowing, softening, lowering | Support return to baseline |
| Stillness | Minimal, very slow, intimate | Withdrawal into presence |

**Grounding voice** is the slowest and softest of the session.
This sets the safety baseline that allows activation to unfold.

**Activation voice** remains stable and unhurried even when
guiding faster breath patterns. The voice provides steady
container; the breath provides the intensity.

**Integration voice** models the return—your voice slows as
you invite breath to slow.

### Breath-Speech Coordination

**Cue during exhale.** The exhale is the parasympathetic moment.
Speaking during exhale reinforces downregulation.

**Silence during inhale.** Let the breath fill without competing
with voice.

**Model the rhythm.** Your speaking rhythm should approximate
the breath rhythm you're inviting. If you're cueing a 5-second
exhale, stretch your phrase across 4-5 seconds.

### Voice During Retention

Retention (kumbhaka) is a silent moment. The voice before
retention should land and complete. The voice after retention
should re-enter softly—not jarring the system that has been
held in stillness.

Before: *"After your next inhale, hold the breath gently..."*

After: *"When you're ready... allowing the exhale to release..."*

### Sensation Cueing in Breathwork

Guide attention inward rather than prescribing experience:

**Instead of:** "Breathe into your belly"
**Use:** "Notice where breath moves in your body"

**Instead of:** "You should feel calm now"
**Use:** "What's the quality of sensation present?"

**Instead of:** "Relax your shoulders"
**Use:** "Notice if there's anywhere you can let go of effort"

Questions develop interoceptive capacity. Commands create
dependence on external instruction.

### Creating Safety for Intensity

Intense breathwork requires trust. Voice builds trust through:

- **Consistency**: Predictable rhythm, no sudden volume shifts
- **Warmth**: Chest resonance, not thin or nasal quality
- **Unhurried quality**: Even when pace is fast, voice is steady
- **Clear re-entry**: After silence, return is announced and soft

**Fragility-inducing language** (avoid): "Be careful," "Don't
push too hard," "Protect yourself from..."

**Resilience-building language** (use): "Notice what's available,"
"Trust what your body is telling you," "Your system knows how to
regulate"

## Depth States

### Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal)

Bringing attention inward toward breath, observing without controlling. External sensory connections gradually diminish. Control of prana drives the senses.

### Dharana (Concentration)

Single-pointed attention on breath. Always present. Bridges voluntary and involuntary function. Creates natural rhythm for attention.

### Traditional Progression Signs (Hatha Yoga Pradipika)

First stage: Perspiration. Middle stage: Trembling. Final stage: Steadiness—breath becomes "motionless."

### Kriyas (Spontaneous Movements)

Trembling, shaking, undulating spine, spontaneous mudras, vocalizations. Traditional view: prana moving through blocked channels, release of samskaras. Physiological view: nervous system reorganization, discharge along motor neurons.

**Response:** Normalize ("entirely harmless, outward expression of inner energy"). Maintain physical safety. Allow but don't encourage. Practitioners should generally be able to control them.

**Concern if:** Cannot control movements. Symptoms persist long after practice. Psychological disturbance. Signs of dissociation.

## Energetic Frameworks

### The Five Vayus

| Vayu | Location | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prana | Heart/lungs/throat | Respiration, reception, vitality |
| Apana | Lower abdomen/pelvis | Elimination, grounding |
| Samana | Navel/solar plexus | Digestion, assimilation, balance |
| Udana | Throat/head | Expression, spiritual ascent |
| Vyana | Whole body | Circulation, integration |

### Ida, Pingala, Sushumna

**Ida:** Left channel, left nostril. Lunar, cooling, parasympathetic, receptive.

**Pingala:** Right channel, right nostril. Solar, heating, sympathetic, active.

**Sushumna:** Central channel through spine. Neutral, pure potential. Channel through which kundalini rises.

Nasal dominance cycles ~90 minutes. Nadi shodhana balances ida and pingala, creating conditions for prana to enter sushumna.

## Integration Note

Science describes mechanism. Tradition describes meaning. Both illuminate. Neither exhausts.

The breath is the teacher. This skill provides what can be known. What cannot be known arrives in the silence between.
