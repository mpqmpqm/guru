description: Specialized guidance for delivering yin yoga classes. Use when generating yin yoga instruction, cueing, sequences, or class scripts. Applies to voice-guided sessions, written sequences, or any yin-specific teaching content. Distinct from vinyasa/yang instruction—yin requires different timing, language patterns, and pedagogical approach.

# Yin Yoga Instruction

This skill provides procedural knowledge for delivering authentic yin yoga instruction based on lineage teachers Paul Grilley, Sarah Powers, and Bernie Clark.

## Core paradigm shift

Yin instruction reverses standard yoga pedagogy:

- **Use the pose to get into the body** (not body into pose)
- **Teacher as facilitator**, not director—students are experts on their own bodies
- **Function over aesthetics**—no "correct" form exists; only appropriate stress in target areas
- **Stillness is the practice**—movement cues minimal after initial setup

## The functional approach

Never cue toward aesthetic alignment. Instead:

1. Identify the **target area** (where stress should be felt)
2. Offer the shape as a vehicle to access that area
3. Accept ANY position that creates appropriate sensation in the target

**Example:** Swan/Pigeon targets outer hip. A student with different hip socket orientation may look completely different from another—both are correct if sensation is in the right place.

Distinguish **tension** (modifiable through practice) from **compression** (bone-on-bone, cannot change). When students hit compression, no amount of effort will take them deeper.

## Verbal cueing principles

**Talk less:** Maximum 30 seconds of speaking per minute. Yin cultivates internal environment—constant talking disturbs this.

**Use invitational language:**
- "You might explore..." / "Perhaps..." / "If it feels right..."
- Add "-ing" to soften commands: "lifting" not "lift"
- Avoid absolutes: never "always," "everyone," "must," "should"

**Avoid:**
- "Embrace the pain" or minimizing sharp sensations
- Yang-style muscular engagement cues
- Aesthetic corrections ("straighten your leg," "point your toes")

**Rhythm for a 3-5 minute hold:**
1. First 1-2 min: offer verbal guidance, alignment suggestions, theme
2. Middle: fall silent—this IS the teaching
3. Final moments: "Three more breaths in this shape..."

See [references/cueing-examples.md](references/cueing-examples.md) for specific language patterns.

## Timing protocol

Hold durations serve connective tissue science:

| Duration | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| 1-2 min | Minimum effective dose; beginners |
| 3-5 min | Standard hold; most practitioners |
| 5-10 min | Deep practice; experienced students |
| 10-20 min | Advanced; specific therapeutic work |

**Key principle:** Time is more important than intensity. Gentle stress held longer > intense stress held briefly.

### The rebound

After each pose, cue 1 minute in neutral (typically supine):
- "Come into a relaxed position"
- "Let your body become still"
- "Notice sensations of tingling, warmth, or fullness"

Tissues are temporarily vulnerable after long holds—the rebound allows them to normalize.

## Teaching the edge

Guide students to find **60% of maximum capacity**—the Goldilocks position.

**Traffic light framework:**
- 🔴 **Red:** Sharp/electrical pain, inability to hold → exit immediately
- 🟡 **Amber:** Significant but sustainable discomfort → target zone
- 🟢 **Green:** No sensation → not enough stress

**Acceptable sensations:** Dull ache, warmth, stretch/compression feeling, mild tolerable discomfort

**Exit signals:** Sharp/shooting pain, burning/tearing, numbness/tingling, bone grinding, breath restriction

Cue that edge is dynamic: "Your edge today may differ from yesterday. It may shift during this hold. Keep listening."

## Meditation integration

Yin poses are laboratories for non-reactive awareness. Weave contemplative elements:

**Options to offer during holds:**
- Breath awareness (observe without manipulating)
- Body scanning through sensation regions  
- Visualization (color, warmth, space)
- Contemplation themes (impermanence, compassion)

**Sarah Powers' framework:** "Suffering comes in reactivity, not in the experience of discomfort." Frame holds as practice for being present with difficulty.

See [references/meditation-integration.md](references/meditation-integration.md) for detailed mindfulness protocols.

## Props and modifications

Props are essential, not accommodations. Present them as equally valid:
- "Place a block under your hand" (not "if you're not flexible enough...")
- Every pose needs 2-3 prop variations available

**Basic setup:** 2 blocks, 2 blankets, 1 bolster

Props serve to:
- Maintain appropriate stress in target areas
- Accommodate skeletal variation
- Protect hypermobile students
- Enable stillness (impossible when struggling against gravity)

Note: prop needs may change during a hold as tissues release.

## Sequencing principles

See [references/poses-and-sequencing.md](references/poses-and-sequencing.md) for the 7 archetypal poses and meridian-based sequences.

**Core principles:**
- Move spine through all ranges: flexion, extension, lateral, twist
- Group poses affecting similar body areas
- Allow adequate rebound between deep holds
- Plan smooth transitions minimizing repositioning
- Yin typically practiced with cool muscles (evening, before yang, standalone)

## Environment and presence

- **Temperature:** Cooler than vinyasa (muscles stay cool to target connective tissue)
- **Lighting:** Soft, dim
- **Sound:** Minimal or absent music
- **Voice:** Soft, steady, natural—avoid affected "yoga voice"
- **Props:** Easily accessible, encourage taking extra

Teacher's regulated nervous system creates the container. Calm, non-reactive presence is itself instruction.

## Common errors to avoid

1. **Talking too much** — disrupts contemplative environment
2. **Treating yin as slow vinyasa** — fundamentally different tissue targeting
3. **Hands-on adjustments pushing deeper** — students must find own edge internally
4. **Rushing transitions/rebounds** — tissues vulnerable after long holds
5. **Insufficient alternatives** — every pose needs multiple supported variations
6. **Aesthetic corrections** — contradicts functional approach
7. **Aggressive strap use** — yin yields to gravity, doesn't force
