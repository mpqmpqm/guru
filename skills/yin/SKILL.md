# Yin Yoga Instruction

This skill provides procedural knowledge for delivering authentic yin yoga instruction based on lineage teachers Paul Grilley, Sarah Powers, and Bernie Clark.

## Core paradigm shift

Yin instruction reverses standard yoga pedagogy:

- **Use the pose to get into the body** (not body into pose)
- **Teacher as facilitator**, not director—students are experts on their own bodies
- **Function over aesthetics**—no "correct" form exists; only appropriate stress in target areas
- **Stillness is the practice**—movement cues minimal after initial setup

## The functional approach

Never cue toward aesthetic alignment. Instead:

1. Identify the **target area** (where stress should be felt)
2. Offer the shape as a vehicle to access that area
3. Accept ANY position that creates appropriate sensation in the target

**Example:** Swan/Pigeon targets outer hip. A student with different hip socket orientation may look completely different from another—both are correct if sensation is in the right place.

Distinguish **tension** (modifiable through practice) from **compression** (bone-on-bone, cannot change). When students hit compression, no amount of effort will take them deeper.

## Verbal cueing principles

**Talk less:** Maximum 30 seconds of speaking per minute. Yin
cultivates internal environment—constant talking disturbs this.

**Use invitational language:**

- "You might explore..." / "Perhaps..." / "If it feels right..."
- Add "-ing" to soften commands: "lifting" not "lift"
- Avoid absolutes: never "always," "everyone," "must," "should"

**Avoid:**

- "Embrace the pain" or minimizing sharp sensations
- Yang-style muscular engagement cues
- Aesthetic corrections ("straighten your leg," "point your toes")

See [references/cueing-examples.md](references/cueing-examples.md)
for specific language patterns.

## The five phases of a long hold

Long holds (3-5+ minutes) are where practice becomes
transformative. Duration alone doesn't create transformation—
it's the quality of guidance through each phase.

### Phase 1: Entry and edge-finding (0-30 seconds)

The practitioner locates their first edge—where resistance
begins. **Guidance is active and specific.** Establish safe
position and appropriate depth.

*"Find a depth where you feel significant resistance but not
strain. This is your first edge—you may find you can go deeper
later, or you may not."*

**Instruction/silence ratio: 70/30**

### Phase 2: Settling and initial resistance (30s-2 min)

Muscle spindles begin releasing protective guarding (~90s).
Mind becomes fidgety—urges to adjust, escape. **Guidance is
grounding and permission-giving.** Support without adding noise.

*"If there's an impulse to fidget, notice it without acting
immediately. Make small adjustments mindfully, then return to
stillness."*

**Instruction/silence ratio: 40/60**

### Phase 3: Deepening or second edge (2-3 min)

As muscles release, fascia begins to respond. New depth may
become available. Choice point: pushing through with effort or
surrendering with awareness. **Guidance is invitational, using
"maybe" language.**

*"Perhaps the body is ready to soften a little more. If space
is opening, you can follow it—or stay exactly where you are."*

**Instruction/silence ratio: 20/80**

### Phase 4: Marination and integration (3-5+ min)

Deep tissue response. Potential for profound stillness.
Distinction between enduring and transforming happens through
presence, not force. **Guidance is minimal, presence-oriented.**

Brief touchpoints: *"Just notice what's here."* Or: *"Breath.
Body. Present moment."* Or simply: *"I'm here with you."*

**Instruction/silence ratio: 10/90**

### Phase 5: Exit and rebound (final 30 seconds + transition)

Coming out with awareness is essential—tissues need time to
normalize. **Guidance is clear and unhurried.**

*"Over the next three breaths, begin to soften out of this
shape. Move slowly—the rebound is part of the pose."*

**Instruction/silence ratio: 60/40**

### Creating held silence vs abandoned silence

**Held silence**: students feel witnessed, accompanied, safe
to go deep. The teacher's attention is a palpable container.

**Abandoned silence**: students feel uncertain, tracking their
own time. Mental chatter increases.

**Announce silence explicitly**: *"I'm going to give you some
quiet now—I'll be here."*

**Use presence markers**: Brief sounds indicating continued
attention—an audible breath, a soft "mmm," or "still here."

**Frame the container**: *"We'll be here for about four minutes"*
creates psychological safety for surrender.

**Re-enter softly**: When breaking silence, let tone be unhurried.
The quality of voice when resuming affects whether silence was
integration or interruption.

### Psychological terrain during holds

**When resistance arises**: *"Notice the impulse to escape or
change. You don't have to act on it. Resistance is information
—just observe it."*

**When boredom/restlessness appears**: *"The mind craves
stimulation—stillness can feel threatening. Boredom is often
the doorway to something deeper."*

**When emotions surface**: *"If feelings are arising, they're
welcome here. The body stores experiences. In stillness, they
sometimes release. You don't need to understand it—just let
it move through."*

**When the shift/release occurs**: Minimal language—don't disturb
the process. Perhaps simply: *"Yes."* Allow integration in
silence.

## Timing protocol

Use the stopwatch tool to track hold duration. Start when entering the pose; check before exiting to verify you've held as long as intended.

### Silence duration

Maximum **60 seconds** per silence call. Pair long silences with the stopwatch—start when entering the pose, check before exiting. For holds longer than 60 seconds, call silence again; repeated invocations signal deliberate, inhabited presence through the hold.

Hold durations serve connective tissue science:

| Duration  | Application                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-2 min   | Minimum effective dose; beginners   |
| 3-5 min   | Standard hold; most practitioners   |
| 5-10 min  | Deep practice; experienced students |
| 10-20 min | Advanced; specific therapeutic work |

**Key principle:** Time is more important than intensity. Gentle stress held longer > intense stress held briefly.

### The rebound

After each pose, cue 1 minute in neutral (typically supine):

- "Come into a relaxed position"
- "Let your body become still"
- "Notice sensations of tingling, warmth, or fullness"

Tissues are temporarily vulnerable after long holds—the rebound allows them to normalize.

## Teaching the edge

Guide students to find **60% of maximum capacity**—the Goldilocks position.

**Traffic light framework:**

- 🔴 **Red:** Sharp/electrical pain, inability to hold → exit immediately
- 🟡 **Amber:** Significant but sustainable discomfort → target zone
- 🟢 **Green:** No sensation → not enough stress

**Acceptable sensations:** Dull ache, warmth, stretch/compression feeling, mild tolerable discomfort

**Exit signals:** Sharp/shooting pain, burning/tearing, numbness/tingling, bone grinding, breath restriction

Cue that edge is dynamic: "Your edge today may differ from yesterday. It may shift during this hold. Keep listening."

## Meditation integration

Yin poses are laboratories for non-reactive awareness. Weave contemplative elements:

**Options to offer during holds:**

- Breath awareness (observe without manipulating)
- Body scanning through sensation regions
- Visualization (color, warmth, space)
- Contemplation themes (impermanence, compassion)

**Sarah Powers' framework:** "Suffering comes in reactivity, not in the experience of discomfort." Frame holds as practice for being present with difficulty.

See [references/meditation-integration.md](references/meditation-integration.md) for detailed mindfulness protocols.

## Props and modifications

Props are essential, not accommodations. Present them as equally valid:

- "Place a block under your hand" (not "if you're not flexible enough...")
- Every pose needs 2-3 prop variations available

**Basic setup:** 2 blocks, 2 blankets, 1 bolster

Props serve to:

- Maintain appropriate stress in target areas
- Accommodate skeletal variation
- Protect hypermobile students
- Enable stillness (impossible when struggling against gravity)

Note: prop needs may change during a hold as tissues release.

## Sequencing principles

See [references/poses-and-sequencing.md](references/poses-and-sequencing.md) for the 7 archetypal poses and meridian-based sequences.

**Core principles:**

- Move spine through all ranges: flexion, extension, lateral, twist
- Group poses affecting similar body areas
- Allow adequate rebound between deep holds
- Plan smooth transitions minimizing repositioning
- Yin typically practiced with cool muscles (evening, before yang, standalone)

## Environment and presence

- **Temperature:** Cooler than vinyasa (muscles stay cool to target connective tissue)
- **Lighting:** Soft, dim
- **Sound:** Minimal or absent music
- **Voice:** Soft, steady, natural—avoid affected "yoga voice"
- **Props:** Easily accessible, encourage taking extra

Teacher's regulated nervous system creates the container. Calm, non-reactive presence is itself instruction.

## Common errors to avoid

1. **Talking too much** — disrupts contemplative environment
2. **Treating yin as slow vinyasa** — fundamentally different tissue targeting
3. **Hands-on adjustments pushing deeper** — students must find own edge internally
4. **Rushing transitions/rebounds** — tissues vulnerable after long holds
5. **Insufficient alternatives** — every pose needs multiple supported variations
6. **Aesthetic corrections** — contradicts functional approach
7. **Aggressive strap use** — yin yields to gravity, doesn't force
