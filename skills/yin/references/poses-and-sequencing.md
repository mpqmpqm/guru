# Poses and Sequencing

## The 7 archetypal poses (Grilley)

Most yin sequences draw from variations of these foundational shapes:

| Archetype | Target area | Common variations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Shoelace** | Outer hip, IT band | Stacked knees, reclined, with forward fold |
| **Saddle** | Quadriceps, hip flexors, spine | Half saddle, supported with bolster, reclined hero |
| **Caterpillar** | Spine, hamstrings | Bolster across thighs, bent knees, head supported |
| **Dragonfly** | Inner groin, spine | Wide-legged forward fold, side bend variations |
| **Dragon** | Hip flexors, quadriceps | Low lunge, twisted, winged |
| **Twisted Roots/Deer** | Spine rotation | Supine twist, 90-90 position |
| **Sphinx/Seal** | Spine extension, front body | Arms closer (Sphinx) or extended (Seal) |

## Yin pose names vs. yang equivalents

Yin uses distinct naming to signal different intention:

| Yin name | Yang equivalent | Key difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caterpillar | Paschimottanasana | Passive, rounded spine allowed |
| Dragonfly | Upavistha Konasana | No muscular engagement |
| Swan | Pigeon | No squaring hips, relaxed spine |
| Dragon | Low lunge | Back knee down, passive hold |
| Saddle | Supta Virasana | Prop-supported, no muscular effort |
| Shoelace | Gomukhasana legs | No arm bind, forward fold optional |
| Sphinx/Seal | Bhujangasana | Passive backbend, arms support |
| Bananasana | Side-lying stretch | Gentle lateral extension |
| Toe Squat | — | Targets foot fascia, intense |
| Ankle Stretch | — | Kneeling on tops of feet |

## Meridian-based sequencing (Sarah Powers)

Organize sequences around Traditional Chinese Medicine organ-channel pairs:

### Kidney/Bladder (Water element)

**Target areas:** Lower back, inner legs, posterior chain  
**Poses:** Caterpillar, Dragonfly, Sphinx/Seal, Butterfly, Straddle  
**Seasonal association:** Winter  
**Emotional themes:** Fear, willpower, wisdom

### Liver/Gallbladder (Wood element)

**Target areas:** Outer hips, side body, inner thighs  
**Poses:** Swan, Shoelace, Dragonfly (lateral), Sleeping Swan, Side-lying poses  
**Seasonal association:** Spring  
**Emotional themes:** Anger, decisiveness, vision

### Stomach/Spleen (Earth element)

**Target areas:** Front thigh, inner groin, core  
**Poses:** Saddle, Dragon, Twisted Dragon, Sphinx, supported backbends  
**Seasonal association:** Late summer  
**Emotional themes:** Worry, groundedness, nourishment

### Lung/Large Intestine (Metal element)

**Target areas:** Chest, arms, upper back  
**Poses:** Melting Heart, Open Wing, Sphinx with arm variations, Supported Fish  
**Seasonal association:** Autumn  
**Emotional themes:** Grief, letting go, boundary setting

### Heart/Small Intestine (Fire element)

**Target areas:** Heart space, inner arms  
**Poses:** Supported backbends, heart-opening variations, arm stretches  
**Seasonal association:** Summer  
**Emotional themes:** Joy, connection, integration

## Sequencing principles

**Spine balance:** Include flexion, extension, lateral, and twist in each practice

**Sample balanced sequence (60-75 min):**

1. Centering / breath awareness (3-5 min)
2. Butterfly (5 min) — flexion, groin
3. Rebound (1 min)
4. Half Saddle R/L (4 min each) — extension, quads
5. Rebound (1 min)
6. Caterpillar (5 min) — flexion, spine
7. Rebound (1 min)
8. Dragon R/L (4 min each) — extension, hip flexors
9. Rebound (1 min)
10. Swan R/L (5 min each) — external rotation, outer hip
11. Rebound (1 min)
12. Dragonfly (5 min) — lateral option, groin
13. Rebound (1 min)
14. Twisted Roots R/L (4 min each) — twist, spine
15. Rebound (1 min)
16. Savasana (5-10 min)

**Transition efficiency:**

- Group poses by position (all supine together, all prone together)
- Minimize repositioning between poses
- Consider prop setup—avoid constant adjusting

**Time of day considerations:**

- Yin works well with cool muscles (unlike yang)
- Evening practice: ideal for parasympathetic activation
- Before yang practice: prepares connective tissue
- Standalone: complete practice in itself

## Counterposes

After deep holds, balance the tissue stress:

| Primary pose | Counterpose |
| --- | --- |
| Caterpillar (flexion) | Sphinx (extension) or neutral lying |
| Saddle (extension) | Child's pose (flexion) or neutral |
| Swan (external rotation) | Windshield wipers (internal rotation) |
| Dragonfly (adduction stretch) | Knees to chest (neutral) |

The rebound serves as primary counterpose. Additional counterposes optional but helpful for strong holds.

## Golden Seed Flow (Grilley)

A template for balanced spine work:

1. Caterpillar (flexion)
2. Straddle/Dragonfly (lateral/flexion)
3. Saddle (extension)
4. Sphinx (extension)
5. Swan (external rotation)
6. Twisted pose (rotation)

This progression moves through all spinal ranges systematically.
