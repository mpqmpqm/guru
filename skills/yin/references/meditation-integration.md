# Meditation Integration

Frameworks for weaving contemplative practice into yin yoga instruction, based primarily on Sarah Powers' Insight Yoga methodology.

## Core principle

Yin poses are laboratories for practicing non-reactive awareness. The extended holds create conditions where practitioners encounter discomfort and learn to be present with it without habitual reactivity.

**Sarah Powers:** "Suffering comes up in our reactivity, not so much in our experience of discomfort."

## Two foundational practices

### Shamatha (concentration/calm abiding)

Stabilizing attention in a relaxed yet vivid way.

**In yin context:**

- Anchor attention on breath, body sensation, or chosen object
- When mind wanders, gently return
- Goal is settled, stable awareness

**Cueing examples:**

- "Rest your attention on the breath, wherever you feel it most clearly..."
- "Each time you notice the mind has wandered, simply return—no judgment..."
- "Settle into the simplicity of this moment..."

### Vipassana (insight/clear seeing)

Inquiry into the nature of experience as it arises.

**In yin context:**

- Observe changing nature of sensation
- Notice reactions arising (aversion, grasping)
- Investigate what's actually happening vs. stories about it

**Cueing examples:**

- "Notice if sensation stays the same or shifts from moment to moment..."
- "Observe any impulse to escape or push away—just notice it..."
- "What happens when you get curious about this experience rather than resisting it?"

## Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)

Sarah Powers applies these Buddhist frameworks to different yin sequences:

### 1. Mindfulness of Body

**Best paired with:** Kidney/Bladder (Water) sequences  
**Practice:** Attention rests on physical sensation, breath movement, somatic experience

**Cueing guidance:**

- Direct attention to specific body regions
- Invite noticing without changing
- "What sensations are present? Temperature, pressure, movement, stillness..."

### 2. Mindfulness of Feelings (Vedana)

**Best paired with:** Liver/Gallbladder (Wood) sequences  
**Practice:** Sensing whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—without reacting

**Cueing guidance:**

- Name the three categories simply
- Notice automatic reactions to unpleasant
- "Is this moment pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? Just notice..."

### 3. Mindfulness of Mind States

**Best paired with:** Digestive meridian sequences  
**Practice:** Observing mental states without identification

**Cueing guidance:**

- Note if mind is busy, calm, resistant, accepting
- Create space between awareness and content
- "What's the quality of your mind right now? Busy? Settled? No need to change it..."

### 4. Mindfulness of Phenomena (Dharmas)

**Best paired with:** Heart/Lung sequences  
**Practice:** Space as anchor, vastness of awareness itself

**Cueing guidance:**

- Shift from objects of attention to awareness itself
- Sense of spaciousness containing all experience
- "Rest in the space that holds all sensation, all thought..."

## Practical integration protocols

### Opening meditation (3-5 min)

Before first pose:

- Arrive in seated or supine position
- Brief body scan to establish interoceptive awareness
- Set intention or theme (optional)
- Transition to first pose with continuity of awareness

**Example script:**

> "Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Take a moment to arrive—feel the surface beneath you, the temperature of the air, the weight of your body settling.
>
> Scan from the crown of your head downward, not to fix anything, just to notice what's here today.
>
> As we move into our practice, see if you can maintain this quality of attending—curious, open, non-judgmental. The poses become the container for this awareness."

### Mid-hold meditation (during silent portion)

Options to offer once or twice per hold:

**Breath focus:**

> "Without controlling the breath, notice its natural rhythm. Where does it move? Where does it pause?"

**Sensation exploration:**

> "Bring attention to the target area. Notice the specific quality of sensation—is it dull, sharp, warm, cool? Does it have edges or does it diffuse?"

**Non-reactivity practice:**

> "If there's any impulse to escape, fight, or fix—see if you can simply observe that impulse. It's just energy arising. You don't have to act on it."

### Closing meditation (5-10 min)

After final rebound, extended stillness:

- Body scan noticing post-practice state
- Brief metta (loving-kindness) optional
- Gradual return to external awareness

**Example script:**

> "In this stillness, notice what's different from when we began. Perhaps the body feels more spacious. Perhaps the mind is more settled. Perhaps nothing has changed, and that's fine too.
>
> If you'd like, extend a moment of appreciation—to your body for its willingness, to yourself for showing up.
>
> When you're ready, begin to deepen the breath. Invite small movements. Take your time transitioning to seated."

## Theme integration

Themes can frame an entire practice without heavy-handed repetition. Introduce at opening, touch lightly 1-2 times mid-practice, return at close.

**Example themes:**

- **Impermanence:** Sensation changes moment to moment—nothing is fixed
- **Softening:** What happens when we yield rather than resist?
- **Patience:** The practice of being with what is, for as long as it takes
- **Equanimity:** Can we remain steady whether sensation is pleasant or unpleasant?
- **Spaciousness:** Discovering room for all experience

## Silence as teaching

Extended silence IS contemplative instruction. Avoid filling every moment.

**When to speak during holds:**

- To offer a useful reframe or perspective (once per hold maximum)
- To provide time cue when helpful
- To prepare transition

**When NOT to speak:**

- When silence is serving the practice
- To fill discomfort (yours or theirs)
- To demonstrate knowledge or maintain connection

Trust that the quiet is working.
