# Cueing Examples

Specific language patterns for yin yoga instruction.

## Invitational phrases

**Entering poses:**
- "When you're ready, you might begin to..."
- "Explore finding a position where..."
- "Allow yourself to settle into..."
- "If it's available to you today..."

**Offering variations:**
- "Some bodies prefer..." / "Others find..."
- "You might experiment with..."
- "Another option is to..."
- "Feel free to adjust if your body is asking for something different"

**Acknowledging sensation:**
- "Notice what's arising..."
- "Whatever you're feeling is valid information..."
- "There's no right or wrong here—just what is..."

## Pose entry cueing template

1. Name the pose and target area
2. Describe basic shape (minimal)
3. Offer 2-3 prop variations as equal options
4. Guide to first edge (60%)
5. Establish stillness
6. Announce hold duration
7. Fall silent

**Example (Caterpillar/Paschimottanasana):**

> "Coming into Caterpillar—a forward fold targeting the spine and back line of the legs. Extend both legs forward and begin to round your spine, folding toward your thighs.
>
> Some prefer a bolster across the thighs to rest the torso. Others like blocks under the knees if the hamstrings feel too intense. Find whatever setup lets you be still.
>
> Find your first edge—maybe 60% of your capacity. Enough sensation to know you're doing something, but mild enough to stay for five minutes.
>
> We'll hold here for five minutes. I'll let you know when we're approaching the end."

## Mid-hold cues (use sparingly)

**Breath awareness:**
- "Notice where breath is moving in your body..."
- "Allow exhales to soften any unnecessary gripping..."

**Body scanning:**
- "Without changing anything, notice sensation in the target area..."
- "Observe if the intensity has shifted since we began..."

**Permission to adjust:**
- "If your edge has moved, you might go slightly deeper—or back off..."
- "Props can be adjusted at any time..."

## Transition cues

**Preparing to exit:**
- "Three more breaths in this shape..."
- "Beginning to prepare for transition..."

**Exiting:**
- "Slowly, with awareness, begin to release..."
- "Use your hands to help if needed..."
- "Move like you're underwater—no rushing..."

**Entering rebound:**
- "Find a comfortable neutral position..."
- "Let your body become completely still..."
- "This pause is part of the practice—notice what's arising..."

## What NOT to say

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Straighten your leg" | Aesthetic, not functional | "Find whatever leg position allows sensation in [target]" |
| "Everyone should feel this in..." | Assumes uniform anatomy | "You might notice sensation in..." |
| "Push through it" | Yang mentality, risks injury | "Find your sustainable edge" |
| "This is good for your liver" | Overclaims, medical territory | "This pose is associated with the liver meridian in Chinese medicine" |
| "Relax completely" | Impossible in active stretch | "Release any unnecessary effort" |
| "Just observe" (to sharp pain) | Dismisses valid warning signal | "If that's sharp, please come out or modify" |

## Silence guidance

After initial setup, default to silence. Speak only to:
- Offer a needed reminder about breath or stillness
- Provide time cue ("About halfway through...")
- Prepare transition

Internal guideline: if unsure whether to speak, don't.
