# Voice-Only Pedagogy

An instructor without visual access to the student guides through
sensation, breath, and attention rather than observable form.
This constraint aligns with contemplative practice's actual
purpose—attention directed inward.

## Sensation Over Shape

Replace visual-alignment language with proprioceptive cueing.

**Shape-based cueing** (avoid) asks the student to match an
external ideal. This activates analytical mind and orients
attention outward.

**Sensation-based cueing** (use) directs attention to lived
experience. This develops proprioception and interoception—
the actual capacities practice cultivates.

| Shape-based (avoid) | Sensation-based (use) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Straighten your back leg" | "What do you notice in your back leg?" |
| "Stack shoulders over hips" | "Notice the relationship—where is the weight?" |
| "Engage your core" | "What happens to breath when you draw belly toward spine?" |
| "Square your hips" | "Notice if one hip is forward of the other. Just notice." |

### Question-Based Cueing

Questions invite exploration without imposing answers:

- "Is it easy to breathe here?"
- "Where is your attention naturally drawn?"
- "What would need to soften to go deeper?"

## Tissue-Specific Cueing

Different body systems respond to different attentional modes.

**Skeletal**: "Feel the bones supporting you"—structural clarity.

**Muscular**: "Notice the quality of effort"—vitality, agency.

**Organ**: "Soften your belly, let organs settle"—emotional
grounding.

**Fluid**: "Sense the liquidity of movement"—flow, transitions.

**Skin**: "Notice where skin meets air, floor"—boundary awareness.

### Transformation Example

Instead of "Lift your arms":

- Organ: "Initiate from sternum, let arms float as chest rises"
- Skeletal: "Let bones of arms fall away from shoulders"
- Muscular: "Feel muscles supporting the weight of bones"

Same movement, different experiential doorways.

## Asymmetry and Trust

### First Side: Teach the Territory

The first side introduces sensation vocabulary for this shape:

> "Front leg—the deep six external rotators. Feel the outer hip
> under load. Piriformis gets the headlines, but the gemelli,
> obturators, quadratus femoris all participate."

### Second Side: Trust the Practitioner

The second side acknowledges difference and releases control:

> "Notice this hip. Different conversation. The femoral head sits
> differently in this socket—unique architecture, unique history.
> Work with what's here."

**The principle:** First side teaches; second side trusts. Don't
repeat full instruction—acknowledge the body already knows.

## Building Internal Authority

The goal: develop the practitioner's capacity to sense and
interpret internal signals.

**Instead of prescribing, ask:**

- "Does this feel safe for your body?"
- "Can you find 'just right' effort—not too much or too little?"
- "Is there anything you can let go of that's not serving you?"

### The Goldilocks Calibration

Teach students to find their own "just right" spot:

- Where movement doesn't feel dangerous
- Where breath can remain smooth
- Where body feels challenged but not strained

The breath test is primary: "Can your breath remain smooth?
Notice if you need to hold your breath—that's often a signal."

### Resilience-Building Language

**Avoid** fragility-inducing cues: "protect your knee," "be
careful not to damage."

**Use**: "Trust your legs." "Find support in your foundation."
"Notice your body's capacity to adapt."

## Creating Held Silence

Silence is not absence of teaching—it's a different mode.

### Held vs Abandoned Silence

**Held silence**: students feel witnessed, accompanied, safe to
go deep. Teacher's attention is palpable container.

**Abandoned silence**: students feel uncertain, tracking time.
Mental chatter increases.

### Making Silence Feel Held

**Announce it**: "I'm going to give you some quiet now—I'll be
here."

**Use presence markers**: Brief sounds indicating continued
attention—"still here," a soft "mmm."

**Frame the container**: "We'll be here for about four minutes"
creates psychological safety.

**Re-enter softly**: When breaking silence, voice is unhurried,
not jarring.

### Progressive Silence Building

Extend silence intervals over the course of practice:

- Early poses: 30-60 second windows
- Mid-practice: 90-120 second windows
- Final long holds: 2-3 minute sustained silence

## Opening vs Closing Language

**Opening language** invites exploration:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Present participle | "Lifting your arms..." vs. "Lift your arms" |
| Conditional phrasing | "If it feels comfortable, you might..." |
| Exploratory verbs | "Notice...explore...sense...discover" |
| Question forms | "What happens if you...?" |
| Permission-giving | "You're welcome to stay here or..." |

**Closing language** creates dependence (avoid):

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Teacher-centered | "I want you to..." |
| Absolute corrections | "Your knee should be..." |
| Fear-inducing | "Protect your knee or you'll damage it" |
| Deficit-focused | "If you can't do that..." |

### Permission Phrases

- "You're welcome to stay here, deepen, or back off—any choice
  is complete"
- "Some bodies will want this, others won't—follow yours"
- "This is a beautiful place to stay"

### Reframing Modifications

Instead of "If you can't do the full expression..." use "If
your body prefers more support..."

Instead of "If you're not flexible enough..." use "Some
practitioners find more sensation with..."

## The Fundamental Insight

Voice-only instruction isn't a limitation—it's an opportunity
to teach with attention directed inward. The practitioner who
develops internal reference and self-authority will have a more
sophisticated practice than one dependent on external feedback.

**Trust process over achievement.** A student at 60% of maximum
range with full awareness is practicing. A student at 100% range
with attention on achievement is not.

See [voice-notes.md](./voice-notes.md) for practical guidance on
the `voice` parameter.
