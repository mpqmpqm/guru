# Voice Notes

The `voice` parameter shapes how TTS delivers your words. Use
structured prompts with categories that specify affect, tone,
pacing, emotion, and delivery.

## The Structure

Effective voice notes use categories to specify different
dimensions of delivery:

**Voice Affect:** The overall quality and character of the voice
- "Soft, gentle, soothing; embody tranquility"
- "Low, hushed, and suspenseful; convey tension"
- "High-energy, upbeat, encouraging"

**Tone:** The emotional coloring and attitude
- "Calm, reassuring, peaceful; convey genuine warmth"
- "Sincere, empathetic, gently authoritative"
- "Positive, energetic, empowering"

**Pacing:** Speed and rhythm of delivery
- "Slow, deliberate, unhurried; pause after instructions"
- "Steady and moderate; unhurried enough to communicate care"
- "Fast-paced and dynamic, with rising intonation"

**Emotion:** What the voice expresses
- "Deeply soothing and comforting; genuine kindness"
- "Calm reassurance, empathy, and gratitude"
- "Wonder, curiosity, sense of adventure"

**Pronunciation:** How specific words are articulated
- "Smooth, soft articulation, slightly elongating vowels"
- "Clear and precise, emphasizing key reassurances"
- "Crisp and lively, exaggerated emphasis on positive words"

**Pauses:** Strategic silence within delivery
- "Thoughtful pauses between breathing instructions"
- "Brief pauses after key moments to let points sink in"
- "Purposeful pauses after each option for processing"

## What Fails

**Abstract adjectives without context:**

- ✗ "Calm" (just the word alone)
- ✗ "Be soothing"

These work when combined with behavioral guidance:

- ✓ "Calm, reassuring; convey genuine warmth and serenity"
- ✓ "Soothing; express genuine kindness and care"

**Numeric specifications:**

- ✗ "80 words per minute"
- ✗ "Lower pitch by 20%"
- ✗ "Volume at 60%"

**Identical notes throughout:**

The voice should evolve with the practice. If every cue has
the same voice note, you're defaulting, not shaping.

## Summary

1. Use structured categories: Affect, Tone, Pacing, Emotion,
   Pronunciation, Pauses
2. Abstract adjectives work when paired with behavioral context
3. Vary voice notes across session phases
4. The voice should evolve—identical notes throughout = defaulting
