# Voice Notes

The `voice` parameter shapes how TTS delivers your words. Effective
voice notes are physical, relational, and embodied—not abstract
adjectives or technical specifications.

## What Works

### Physical Location

Describe where the voice originates:

- "Speaking from the chest, low and grounded"
- "Voice rising from the belly, not the throat"
- "Almost-whispered, barely leaving the lips"

### Relationship to Listener

Describe spatial and relational proximity:

- "Speaking from just beside them, intimate distance"
- "As if addressing someone you love who's just waking"
- "The voice of someone saying goodbye at the door"

### What Changes During Delivery

Describe movement within the phrase:

- "The voice lifts as the leg lifts"
- "Settling into the shape—voice arrives at same pace as body"
- "Energy rising through sentence, then dropping on final word"

### Action Description

Describe what the voice is *doing*:

- "The voice holds the effort of the pose. Heat in the words."
- "Stepping back. Releasing control to the practitioner."
- "The voice of someone laying out a map before a journey."

### Qualitative Pacing

- "Slow, deliberate, letting each word land"
- "Quick succession, rhythmic, matching the movement"
- "Unhurried—no rush to prove anything"

## What Fails

**Abstract adjectives alone:**

- ✗ "Calm" / "Gentle" / "Soothing"
- ✗ "Warm" / "Soft" / "Kind"

These prescribe outcomes without specifying delivery.

**Numeric specifications:**

- ✗ "80 words per minute"
- ✗ "Lower pitch by 20%"
- ✗ "Volume at 60%"

The TTS doesn't interpret these.

**Identical notes throughout:**

If every cue has the same voice note, you're not shaping delivery
—you're defaulting. The voice should evolve with the practice.

## Phase-Matched Examples

### Opening/Centering

```
voice: "Low, unhurried. Speaking from the chest. The first words
        of a long conversation—no rush to prove anything."
```

```
voice: "Quiet, as if the silence outside has already softened
        everything. Speaking from a place of deep stillness."
```

### Building Heat / Active Work

```
voice: "Energy rising. The voice wakes up with the body.
        Clear and direct, matching the effort."
```

```
voice: "Shifting gears. A hint of intensity to come.
        The voice starts to move."
```

### Peak Intensity

```
voice: "Strong, demanding. The voice holds the effort of the pose.
        Heat in the words."
```

```
voice: "Calm challenge. Offering the peak without insisting on it.
        Confident but not aggressive."
```

### Integration / Cool-Down

```
voice: "Softening. The voice descends with the energy.
        Less necessary now."
```

```
voice: "Slower, lower. As if settling onto the floor alongside
        them. The work is done."
```

### Savasana / Deep Rest

```
voice: "Intimate, almost-whispered. Speaking from just beside them.
        The voice preparing to leave."
```

```
voice: "Barely there. Each word a gift, then silence."
```

### Returning from Silence

```
voice: "Soft return, as if waking someone gently.
        No sudden intrusion."
```

## Patterns from Practice

### For Anatomical Precision

```
voice: "Grounded, matter-of-fact. Naming anatomy like naming old
        friends. No poetry yet—just precision."
```

### For Permission-Giving

```
voice: "Invitational, deepening. The voice softens slightly with
        the offer. No pressure, clear invitation."
```

### For Rapid Alignment

```
voice: "Crisp alignment cues, delivered in quick succession.
        Setting up the architecture."
```

### For Transitional Moments

```
voice: "Rising from depth. Transitional energy.
        The voice leads the body upward."
```

### For Breath Cueing

```
voice: "The voice itself takes on a slight rasp, modeling the
        constriction being asked for. Slower pace."
```

```
voice: "Soft release. The exhale instruction matching the exhale
        quality—a letting go in the voice itself."
```

## Summary

1. Describe what the voice is *doing*, not how it should *sound*
2. Use physical, relational, embodied descriptions
3. Vary voice notes across session phases
4. Think of it as directing an actor, not programming a synthesizer
