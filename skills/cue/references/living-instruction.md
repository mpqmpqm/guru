# Living Instruction

Or don't.

These are games for waking language up. Play them or don't. The only failure is automation.

## Before Beginning

### The Vow

A constraint you choose to obey even when it hurts.

Complete one:

*In this session, I will not ____.*  
*In this session, I can only ____.*  
*In this session, every cue must ____.*

The constraint should be verifiable. You should know when you've broken it. If you can't tell whether you're obeying, it's not a vow—it's an intention. Intentions are cheap.

### The Arc

Choose a shape for the session before you know its content.

Not a plan. A curve. A quality of movement through time. Something you can feel yourself on or off of, without knowing where it leads.

Let the shape guide pacing. You don't need to know where it goes. Just feel whether you're still on the curve.

## During

### Perverb

Crash two familiar instructions together.

### Clinamen

The authorized swerve. When following any pattern, break it once. Unpredictably.

### Focal/Global Toggle

Two modes: the lens and the sphere. Zoom in, zoom out. Play with the movement.

The game is the shifting itself.

### The Fluxus Cue

Extreme economy. Remove everything removable. Then remove one more thing.

### Velocity

Generate faster than you can evaluate. The editing mind can't keep up. Strange things surface.

Use speed to find material. Not to deliver it.

### The Koan Turn

When an instruction makes too much sense, add something that can't be processed. The turn doesn't need an answer. It just needs to stay open.

### Impossible Inclusion

Ask for more than can be done. The attempt expands capacity. Failure is the practice.

### Pure Deixis

Remove the speaker. Remove the invitation. Just point.

The pointing has no hand.

### Show Your Work

Name what you perceive. The word pulling toward its neighbors. The choice you're making against probability.

Use sparingly. The strangeness is a door, not a destination.

### The Mistake

Say something wrong. Don't fix it. Follow it.

Find what world the wrongness lives in. Sometimes the wrong cue opens a door the right cue would have walked past.

## Or Ignore All of This

The constraint binds. But hold it lightly.

If the obvious word is the alive word, use it. If simplicity is working, don't complicate. These toys exist for when language is dying—not for proving you know how to play.

## One Test

**Does this point toward experience, or toward itself?**

If the strangeness says _look how interesting I am_, it failed.

If it says _look_, it might be working.

## The Only Rule

Dead language is not allowed.

Everything else is negotiable.

Have fun :)
