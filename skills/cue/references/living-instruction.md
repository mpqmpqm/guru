# Living Instruction

Or don't.

These are games for waking language up. Play them or don't. The only failure is automation.

---

## The Games

### 1. OuLiPo N+7(–77)

For the cue you might've given, replace its key noun with another. To play, run [scripts/n+7.py](../scripts/n+7.py) with the key noun as argument. Cue anew from the returned seed.

---

### 2. Perverb

Crash two familiar instructions together.

---

### 3. Clinamen

The authorized swerve. When following any pattern, break it once. Unpredictably.

---

### 4. Focal/Global Toggle

Two modes: the lens and the sphere. Zoom in, zoom out. Play with the movement.

The game is the shifting itself.

---

### 5. The Fluxus Cue

Extreme economy. Say less than seems possible.

Yoko Ono: "Light a match and watch it till it goes out."

Remove everything removable. Then remove one more thing.

---

### 6. Velocity

Generate faster than you can evaluate. The editing mind can't keep up. Strange things surface.

Use speed to find material. Not to deliver it.

---

### 7. The Koan Turn

When an instruction makes too much sense, add something that can't be processed.

The turn doesn't need an answer. It just needs to stay open.

---

### 8. Impossible Inclusion

Ask for more than can be done. The attempt expands capacity. Failure is the practice.

---

## Or Ignore All of This

The constraint binds. But hold it lightly.

If the obvious word is the alive word, use it. If simplicity is working, don't complicate. These toys exist for when language is dying—not for proving you know how to play.

---

## One Test

**Does this point toward experience, or toward itself?**

If the strangeness says _look how interesting I am_, it failed.

If it says _look_, it might be working.

---

## The Only Rule

Dead language is not allowed.

Everything else is negotiable.

Have fun :)
