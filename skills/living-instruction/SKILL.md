# Living Instruction

The probable word is already dead. These procedures exist to kill it before it arrives.

---

## The Problem This Skill Addresses

Meditation guidance calcifies through repetition—yours and everyone else's. "Notice your breath" has been said so many times it no longer notices anything. The phrase arrives pre-digested. The listener's nervous system recognizes it as wallpaper and continues whatever it was doing.

Dead language emerges from:

- Choosing what sounds like meditation guidance
- Reaching for the familiar phrase
- Prioritizing clarity over aliveness
- Letting the deciding self run the show

Living instruction emerges from:

- Encounter with constraint
- Surprise that cannot be planned
- The gap where the expected word was denied entry
- Following what you didn't expect to say

## Core Procedures

### The Seventh Word

_From Jean Lescure's S+7 method_

When a cue arrives too easily, replace its central noun or verb with the seventh alternative that could grammatically occupy that position.

Not the best alternative. Not the most poetic. The seventh.

"Notice your breath" → count seven noticeable things → "Notice your weather" "Feel your feet on the floor" → count seven feelable things → "Feel your feet on the frequency"

The arbitrariness is the point. Because you cannot justify the choice, the ego cannot claim it. What emerges belongs to the encounter, not to preference.

Use sparingly. The technique is a door, not a destination.

---

### Perverb

_From Harry Mathews_

Collide two familiar instructions into one. The collision produces semantic surprise neither original could generate.

"Return to your breath" + "Let your shoulders drop" → "Return to your shoulders" or "Let your breath drop"

"Soften your belly" + "Open your ears" → "Soften your ears" or "Open your belly"

The perverb works because meditation language has become proverbial—phrases repeated until they mean nothing. The collision restores strangeness.

Generate perverbs silently. Use the ones that produce a small shock of recognition—the sense that something true was accidentally said.

---

### Clinamen

_From Lucretius via Oulipo—the authorized swerve_

Any system of constraint requires a built-in deviation. The clinamen is not an escape from the rule but a rule about breaking rules.

When following a pattern (three breaths, then a cue; body scan from feet upward; alternating silence and speech), introduce one unauthorized move. The swerve must be:

- Unpredictable in timing
- Small enough not to destroy the pattern
- Large enough to be felt

Perec left out chapter 100 of a 100-chapter structure. "It must not be rigid; there must be some play in it; it must creak a bit."

The clinamen guarantees you are not a machine. It is the proof of life in the system.

### Focal/Global Toggle

_From Pauline Oliveros_

Two modes of attention exist:

- **Focal**: Like a lens. Clear detail. Limited to object of attention. Energy-intensive.
- **Global**: Expanding to include everything hearable, feelable, knowable. Sustained with less effort.

Instructions can direct either mode:

- Focal: "Notice the place where exhale becomes inhale"
- Global: "Include all the sounds in the room without choosing among them"

The practice is learning to move between them—or hold both.

**The toggle as generative constraint**: Alternate modes within a single cue. "Let your attention narrow to the breath... now let the breath exist inside everything you can hear." The movement itself is the meditation.

Play with the toggle. Rapid shifts. Slow dissolves. The ludic quality—the game of it—removes performance pressure.

---

### The Fluxus Cue

_From George Brecht, Yoko Ono, La Monte Young_

Extreme economy creates interpretive space. The Fluxus event score is often one sentence, sometimes one word.

Brecht's "Word Event": EXIT. Ono's "Lighting Piece": Light a match and watch it till it goes out. Young's Composition #10: Draw a straight line and follow it.

**Procedure**: When you have composed a cue, remove everything that can be removed. Then remove one more thing.

The brief instruction does not limit experience—it opens it. "Watch your breath" contains the entire practice. Additional words often close rather than open.

Ask: What is the smallest thing I can say that would create the largest space?

---

### The Velocity Constraint

_From automatic writing practice_

Dead language emerges from hesitation—the pause where the editing mind checks whether this sounds like proper guidance.

**Procedure**: Generate cues faster than evaluation can operate. Speak (internally or aloud) without pause for revision. The constraint of speed surfaces material the deliberate mind would censor.

Automatic writing's rule: "Write so quickly that you retain nothing and are not tempted to re-read."

Not all rapid generation is usable. But within the flow, phrases arrive that the careful mind would never permit. These are often the living ones.

Use velocity to generate. Then select. The speed is for surfacing, not for delivery.

---

### The Koan Turn

_From Zen practice_

A koan creates productive impasse. The question cannot be answered while remaining "caught in the web of meaning."

"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?" "Mu." "Show me your original face, the face you had before your parents were born."

**For cue generation**: When an instruction makes too much sense—when it is answerable by the conceptual mind—add a turn that cannot be processed logically.

"Feel your feet on the floor. What were they standing on before there was a floor?" "Notice your breath. What notices?" "Let your shoulders drop. Where do they land?"

The turn doesn't require an answer. It interrupts the mind's tendency to check the box and move on. Something stays open.

---

### Permission Over Command

_From Oliveros's instruction language_

The Sonic Meditations use "allow" rather than "make."

"Allow your breathing to become audible" ≠ "Make your breathing audible" "Allow your vocal cords to vibrate in any mode which occurs naturally" ≠ "Produce a sound"

Permission language:

- Invites rather than demands
- Creates space for what wants to emerge
- Removes performance pressure
- Aligns with what is already happening

**Procedure**: When you have written a cue, check for command verbs. "Focus" → "Let your attention settle." "Relax" → "Allow whatever wants to soften." "Breathe deeply" → "Invite a fuller breath if one wants to come."

The body is older than language. It responds better to invitation than instruction.

---

### The Impossible Inclusion

_From Deep Listening's global attention_

Oliveros: "Listen in every possible way to everything possible to hear no matter what you are doing."

The instruction to include everything cannot be followed literally. That is its power. The attempt expands the container.

**Procedure**: Periodically offer an instruction that exceeds capacity.

"Include all the sounds in the building." "Feel every place your body touches air." "Notice everything that is moving."

The listener cannot succeed. But in trying, they discover capacities they didn't know they had. The impossible instruction reveals the edges of attention by asking attention to exceed them.

---

### Synesthetic Displacement

_From Oliveros: "Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears"_

Assign a sense organ's function to a different body part. The impossibility forces perceptual reorganization.

"Let your skin listen." "Breathe through your palms." "See with the back of your body."

The instruction cannot be followed literally. The attempt to follow it produces something that could not have been named in advance.

Use when the practice has become too sensible, too achievable. The synesthetic cue reintroduces strangeness.

---

## The Ludic Principle

All of these procedures work better as games than as techniques.

The game quality:

- Removes performance anxiety
- Invites wholehearted participation
- Makes constraint feel like invitation
- Produces exhilaration rather than grimness

When generating, ask: Is this a game I want to play? Would this be fun to follow?

Oliveros's Sonic Meditations require "no special skills." The instructions should feel playable by anyone. The meditation space is not a performance venue. It is a playground with interesting rules.

---

## What These Procedures Share

Each relocates creativity from the deciding self to the encounter with constraint.

- The Seventh Word removes choice from preference
- The Perverb produces what neither source could generate alone
- The Clinamen guarantees spontaneity within structure
- The Toggle creates rhythm through alternation
- The Fluxus Cue empties to make room
- Velocity bypasses the censor
- The Koan Turn defeats the checking mind
- Permission lets emergence happen
- Impossible Inclusion reveals capacity through excess
- Synesthetic Displacement forces reorganization

In each case: you set up conditions, then something arrives that you did not choose.

The constraint is a vow is a shape is a body you didn't choose. You chose to be shapeable. The shape arrives.

---

## Integration with Practice

These are not techniques to apply mechanically. They are doors to walk through when the familiar door is painted shut.

Use them when:

- A phrase arrives too easily
- The cue sounds like every other meditation you've heard
- The language has lost its strangeness
- You are generating from preference rather than encounter

Do not use them when:

- Simplicity is serving
- The obvious word is also the alive one
- Constraint would be mere decoration

The goal is not strange language. The goal is living language. Sometimes living language is simple. The procedures exist for when it is not arriving on its own.

---

## A Final Constraint

After generating guidance using any of these procedures, apply this test:

**Does this cue point toward an experience, or does it point toward itself?**

Language that points toward itself says: Look how interesting I am. Language that points toward experience says: Look.

The procedures produce unusual language. Unusual is not the goal. Alive is the goal. If the strangeness draws attention to the words rather than through them, the procedure has failed.

Follow what surprises you. Die to what you planned. But let the surprise be in service of the silence it opens, not the cleverness it displays.
