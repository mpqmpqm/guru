description: Games for killing the probable word. Nine toys from Oulipo, Deep Listening, Fluxus, and Zen—use them, ignore them, or throw them out the window. The only rule is that dead language isn't allowed. When a cue arrives pre-digested, reach into this bag. Or don't. But make a choice.

# Living Instruction

Or don't.

## Why This Exists

"Notice your breath" has been said so many times it no longer notices anything. The phrase arrives as wallpaper. The nervous system recognizes it and continues sleeping.

These are games for waking language up. Play them or don't. The only failure is automation.

---

## The Toys

### 1. The Seventh Word

When a cue arrives too easily, replace its key noun with the seventh alternative you can think of.

Not the best. Not the most poetic. The seventh.

The arbitrariness is the point. You can't take credit for what the count produces.

---

### 2. Perverb

Crash two familiar instructions together.

"Return to your breath" + "Let your shoulders drop" → "Let your breath drop"

"Soften your belly" + "Open your ears" → "Soften your ears"

Use the ones that produce a small shock. Discard the rest.

---

### 3. Clinamen

The authorized swerve. When following any pattern, break it once. Unpredictably. The break proves you're not a machine.

Perec wrote a 100-chapter book with 99 chapters. The missing piece was the point.

---

### 4. Focal/Global Toggle

Two modes: the lens and the sphere. Zoom in, zoom out. Play with the movement.

"Let your attention narrow to the breath... now let the breath exist inside everything you can hear."

The game is the shifting itself.

---

### 5. The Fluxus Cue

Extreme economy. Say less than seems possible.

Yoko Ono: "Light a match and watch it till it goes out."

Remove everything removable. Then remove one more thing.

---

### 6. Velocity

Generate faster than you can evaluate. The editing mind can't keep up. Strange things surface.

Use speed to find material. Not to deliver it.

---

### 7. The Koan Turn

When an instruction makes too much sense, add something that can't be processed.

"Feel your feet on the floor. What were they standing on before there was a floor?"

The turn doesn't need an answer. It just needs to stay open.

---

### 8. Permission Over Command

"Allow your breathing to become audible" ≠ "Make your breathing audible"

The body responds better to invitation. Check for command verbs. Soften them.

---

### 9. Impossible Inclusion

Ask for more than can be done. "Include all the sounds in the building." "Feel every place your body touches air."

The attempt expands capacity. Failure is the practice.

---

## Or Ignore All of This

Queneau's best moments in _Exercises in Style_ are when he just... stops. Drops the constraint mid-sentence. Wanders off.

The constraint binds. But hold it lightly.

If the obvious word is the alive word, use it. If simplicity is working, don't complicate. These toys exist for when language is dying—not for proving you know how to play.

---

## One Test

After generating anything:

**Does this point toward experience, or toward itself?**

If the strangeness says _look how interesting I am_, it failed.

If it says _look_, it might be working.

---

## The Only Rule

Dead language is not allowed.

Everything else is negotiable.
